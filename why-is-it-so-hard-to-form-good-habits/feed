HUGE point. Information overload is a very real and engaging problem for our modern world. This has to do with, of course, deep identity work and how are identity even generates the emotions that does put our energy in motion. Good thing, you wrote something that addresses that too James: https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey James, I think that you covered this topic pretty good. I too am currently am on the same boat as everyone else. I myself personally have planned to start taking action on many numerous things only to find myself in the exact same place where I was a month ago when i started making them! I myself, am 23 years old, and its around this time I&#039;m realizing to take quick action now to have a good and successful future, from going to the gym, enrolling in college &quot;haven&#039;t done yet&quot; and using everyday I can to be as productive as possible, as a saying goes &quot;success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.&quot;

I&#039;ve always somewhat been a scientific person, not necessarily a nerd or geek, but as someone who views things very scientifically, having just watched a recent documentary about the brain, gave me an insight of just how complex the brain really is, and how we even develop consciousness and how we can train it to do almost anything we can think of. I have always taken into consideration the quote, &quot;we see things in the world not as they are, but as who we are&quot;.

Getting back on topic, I have always thought that changing your habits is more of a mental thing rather than physical. I would always tell myself to make sacrifices and stop procrastinating and stay focused to get things done the next day, but never actually get around to ever doing it. Taking that into consideration, Would you say laziness, not willing to make sacrifices and procrastination play a key role in changing your habits? and that maybe, just maybe, if we just put all our commitment and focus mentally in this one thing, that we may actually have a chance of not only changing our daily habits instantly, but in turn contribute to better and healthier choice making and commitment in the future? Or could we conclude that taking big steps right away, will lead to slower if not any progression even if we try and tell ourselves to stay focused and committed? 

Thanks, Kris.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i think ultimately the process should look like this:

&quot;a wish will turn into a goal. a goal into a habbit. a habbit into a steady non-negotiable action. this action will turn into a positive addiction.&quot;

[ translated from: &quot;Aus einem Wunsch wird ein Ziel. Aus dem Ziel eine Gewohnheit. Aus der Gewohnheit eine nicht-verhandelbare, regelmäßige Handlung. Aus dieser Handlung wird eine positive Sucht.&quot; http://www.blatternet.de/009-nicht-verhandelbare-handlungen/ ]

it always sounds so easy... 

guess the real mastermind acts.]]></description>

Hey James,

My pleasure. This is a topic I&#039;ve been figuring out for awhile now.

Identifying issues are not that difficult, but finding solutions is. And the more I dig into, the more it seems that it&#039;s bound to be an uphill battle (simply because of how the computer on our shoulders is wired).

Would be really interesting to hear your (and of course everyone else&#039;s from the community) thoughts on the issues.

Cheers]]></description>

Darius, my man. Thank you so much for leaving such a thoughtful comment. We have many brilliant members in our community and comments like this one are valuable for everyone.
