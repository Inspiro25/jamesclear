					<description><![CDATA[When I coached upper level kids hockey and figure skating, it was difficult to get this through the young skaters head that to be good takes tremendous work.  Parents would criticize because they wanted the &quot;hack&quot;, that thing that was going to make their kid great.  And, of course, I knew better, that it is the basic, good function, over time that gets the job done.  

Thank you, James, for reminding me of that, because I can take it to the bank and give a good reminder to myself how this all works so perfectly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this article!  I have been reading your articles because I want to learn how to be more consistent in putting my energies into what matters to me.  I can say with 100% certainty that I can do it.  Why?  Because I have done it without my knowing in two different areas, exercise and gardening.  With exercise, years ago I dropped the idea of looking like Beyonce tomorrow and just started exercising little by little.  Today I still don&#039;t look like Beyonce, but even better, I am so happy with myself!  With gardening I began one summer destroying most of the plants I tried to grow... 7 years later through trial and error and not giving up because I found the experience both challenging and joyful, I now have people complimenting me for my luscious garden!  There are some goals I haven&#039;t been so lucky with, though.  This article has helped me understand my frustration.  Unlike exercise and gardening, these activities are more &quot;deliberate&quot; improvements on what I consider personal weaknesses that I&#039;m aware of... maybe that&#039;s what makes them so different.  Just more time, consistency and practice needs to be put into it.  So I&#039;m going to keep pushing on.  Thank you!]]></description>
