					<description><![CDATA[James, what an interesting and inspiring post indeed. I missed reading it earlier, while browsing thru old mails came across this.

I too believe in the purpose of creation to be of utility for the benefit of mankind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since I subscribed several months ago, I have read every article. This is one of the most touching for me so far. I create something every day and it makes me incredibly happy. I wish everybody who has the inner must to create something would discover what he or she could create. Nicely put last two paragraphs, almost made me cry. :) 

Congratulations!

P.S. I have had an &quot;idea rush&quot; in the last few days. Now I want to make short movies out of your articles, Mr. Clear! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again for motivation, that our life must matter. We exist each for a purpose  and our time is limited, so create for others to continue to enjoy!

Love, peace and happiness! We share our love every chance we have, results - inner and outer peace; around us others will be happy base on each life we touch - thus multiplication of/into happiness over and over again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Creativity is the spice of life. I can&#039;t imagine my life without it. Luckily, I don&#039;t have to.  I grew up in a family of creative people, and it has always been around me and is natural to me.  As an entrepreneur, I am always creating my business, whether it&#039;s programs, marketing, events, income-producing ideas.  My clients are artists and art collectors.  We all appreciate having creativity in our lives.

When I&#039;m not being creative, I feel like something is missing.

I encourage more people to look to art and artists for inspiration.  They are the makers.  Creativity is the act of making something out of nothing, or making something out of something that didn&#039;t exist before.  Support artists by bringing art into your life by buying an artwork that you like and bringing it home to live with.  When you connect with the creativity in art, it will inspire you in ways you never knew possible.  I encourage you to open yourself up to this.]]></description>

Fair question, but I think you can file this one under, &quot;Everyone will never do it.&quot;

It&#039;s sort of like telling people not to travel because if everyone was traveling, then nobody would be there to open the hotels, fly the airplanes, and run the businesses. (It will never happen, so that&#039;s not a good reason for not traveling.)

Also, the nice thing about being a human is that we can change our minds. If everyone magically becomes a leader, then you can choose to follow someone who inspires you. In the meantime, choose to lead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again, James, for your encouragement and proding by example!  I followed through a door you opened and started my blog: foodtalk4you.com.  If you had not walked us through the steps last November, I don&#039;t know how I would have started at all.  You said the thing to do is to be consistent first and not worry about beauty, but since I am writing about food, a friend is helping me bring my site to life with pictures.  This is an exciting learning curve and the realization of a two year dream. Still tweeking; trying to get a leave a reply and subscription options, but all in good time.  I will be teaching some food classes at church next week!  Flying on the wings of faith! Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this &quot;We need secretaries who make jewelry as a side project.&quot; But, &quot;We need more leaders, not more followers.&quot;

Who will the leaders lead if everyone is a leader?]]></description>
