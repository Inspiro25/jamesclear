					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

This is an amazing message, and I love the story of the Tendai monks. Funny that I have been to Kyoto over a dozen times [I&#039;ve lived in Japan for 16 years] but have never heard of the monks or their amazing feats. And, it goes to show the power of commitment and that, if they can do that, we can do absolutely anything... without having to die for it. 

Thanks for the post!

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for coming up with this awestruck-ing article... The gravity of those monks mental commitment is really unimaginable to the modern mankind. This is and should be an eye-opener for all those people who dream of utilizing their own untapped Human potential. 

I really feel like saying &quot;These Monks are as inspiring as BATMAN, right there, or probably even better.&quot;]]></description>
