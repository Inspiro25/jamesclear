					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/good-habits#comment-4583&quot;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;.

I see only one sensible option. When possible, try to make it fun/enjoyable/sexy/novel/exciting but if you can&#039;t, do it anyway. Then  congratulate yourself for doing something you don&#039;t like that you know is good for you, and then do some more of it until you don&#039;t think about it very much. Only these past months am I realizing that the reluctance I have for some tasks/activities only lasts a few weeks.  Remind yourself that you like the results more than the discomfort. Or, you could scare yourself with fear of disaster, like double-bypass at age 40, or whatever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Yesterday I started walking the dog morning and night for about 45 minutes each time. Here&#039;s the kicker - I don&#039;t have a dog. Well, not a real one at least. I have one in mind though and with that thinking I can leverage off the responsibility that comes with pet ownership and use that to support my habit forming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another great post, as usual. 

Still working on my writing and photography schedule, which I started in part because of the advice you&#039;ve given on starting good habits. I&#039;m currently on week six, and haven&#039;t missed a photo yet (posting a good one each week on my website). Hopefully it&#039;ll keep up, but if something does happen, I like the &quot;never miss twice&quot; rule.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the simplicity of this piece.  I like the part about never missing twice.  I&#039;m totally a person who feels like they aren&#039;t made for exercise and can&#039;t stop eating sweets.  If you could write something on not eating sweets it would be really helpful.  I also think the part about writing 3 sentences a day is really inspiring.  I&#039;m trying to develop my writing and am struggling.  I&#039;d love to hear from you.  Feel free to email me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use to have this idea about myself that I wasn&#039;t fussed about exercise. The way that the people around me treated me also enforced this idea; I was worried that if I changed my ways they&#039;d notice and think I&#039;d lost the plot. Then somebody I knew started working out regularly and after a short time they were already looking healthier and trimmer; I decided I wanted the same. I signed up for a short marathon to give me a goal to train for which really helped. Afterwards I noticed positive changes in my confidence,  posture, energy levels... etc... I didn&#039;t realise before how much better regular exercise would make me feel; It has since become a part of my identity.  The way we see ourselves really makes a big difference.  I have a friend who I think is holding himself back; he often talks about himself as being incapable of certain things like creativity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post James. One of my favorite mental tricks for when I get thrown off is to plan my &quot;turnaround day.&quot; This is the day that I will get back to eating healthy or working out or whatever it is. This is the day I know I will get back on track.]]></description>

&quot;Just man up and do it&quot;?]]></description>
