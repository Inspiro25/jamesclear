					<description><![CDATA[James,

I&#039;ve theorized about this before, but I&#039;ve never been able to formulate it as well as this. If anything the fact that you advocate this becomes an instant excuse eliminator, so now I have no choice but to get back to building a more positive and proactive identity!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good day James,

The small increasing/bettering goal, that you are teaching is known as the Kaizen method. It`s a Japanese term for small stage improvements constantly.

Hey James, you have traveled extensively world wide, but have you visited South Africa? It&#039;s a beautiful country with a lot of different landscapes to see, and to photograph. We have beautiful beaches, mountains, deserts, forests just to mention a few. It would also be affordable as our Rand is 10.4 to the Dollar.

Regards,
John]]></description>

Over at ReCreateYourLike.com, Morty Lefkoe has a free belief eliminator so you can get rid of one belief. Basically, he helps you see that you developed your self-esteem beliefs between the ages of birth and six and that these developed when we place a meaning/interpretation of our parents&#039; behavior. This usually happens after several incidences. His program helps you think of other interpretations we put on other&#039;s behavior, in this case, our parents. When we realize our interpretations and &quot;aren&#039;t the truth&quot;, the belief disappears. It&#039;s an interactive program; he offers a Natural Confidence DVD also. It helped me tremendously in raising my level of confidence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I&#039;m new and I&#039;m really enjoying your articles!  I started training with an olympic weightlifting coach about 18 months ago.  I am only able to train once per week so my progress is slow but steady. I understand and can implement strategies for adding in good habits.  Start small, focus on the process, set yourself up for success right from the start.  My first clean was 7K (yes, seven) now it&#039;s 30K and I&#039;ll be at 35K by Memorial Day.  I get that. Maybe in another year I&#039;ll be at 50K.  I started lifting when I was 51 years old and I am never going to stop.

 But I am having a hard time with eliminating bad habits.  Specifically:  food.  More specifically:  portion control and frequency of eating.  I don&#039;t have &quot;bad&quot; food in the house.  I eat good carbs, lean meats, vegetables, fruits, limited dairy and I stay away from rice, pasta, potatoes.  Bread is my downfall so I try to keep that out of my sight.   But I eat a TON -- way more than I should.  And I fall off the bread and chocolate wagon regularly.  Thoughts on changing bad habits?   (I have no medical or health problems.)  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/identity-votes#comment-8200&quot;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt;.

I actually came here to say that I used this approach to finally kick smoking to the curb. For years I went back and forth between full-time smoker and &quot;social&quot; smoker - telling myself and my friends that I &quot;only smoke when I drink&quot;... or &quot;only smoke when I&#039;m camping&quot;... or &quot;only smoke when I&#039;m stressed&quot;.. or whatever the occasion was that I used as an excuse. 

Recently, I read something similar to what James has mentioned above - change your beliefs about yourself. The next time I was in a situation where I would smoke &quot;Socially&quot; I said no thanks, I&#039;m not a smoker. The first time I stayed behind while my &quot;smoking buddies&quot; went and smoked was the hardest, but it gets easier every time.
 
And I tell myself that every day - NOT that I&#039;m a former smoker, not that I&#039;m a social smoker, just that I am NOT a smoker. It&#039;s changed my beliefs about myself - I don&#039;t want to be the type of person who blows money on such a stinky habit - or is controlled by nicotine - or dies of cancer because of my own actions -  so I decided to NOT be that person anymore.

It&#039;s hard some times, but I just DON&#039;T smoke. Because I&#039;m not a smoker.
This was relatively easy for me once I changed my thinking - but unrelated to this article - I have heard EXCELLENT things about Alan Carr&#039;s book - Easy Way to Stop Smoking. 

Good luck!]]></description>
