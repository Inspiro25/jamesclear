					<description><![CDATA[Hi James! 

Thanks for this. Just read you &quot;what happens to our brains when we eat junk food&quot; and I&#039;ve made it here and joined the newsletter whoo!

Read quite abit about fasting and after reading this article I&#039;m starting tomorrow. :-) I am going to start off with the no breakfast rule cycle and see how that goes. My biggest issue is normally I like to eat no later than 6pm but my partner likes to eat dinner after this so this might work in well with me having my dinners then. Fingers crossed got kilos to lose, more health to gain. Looking forwards to being apart of the community.

					<description><![CDATA[Just started doing this and I have a lot of energy (even during my workout which is done while fasted)

I&#039;m not being too particular about making sure I have something to eat exactly after that 16 hour mark or finish a meal RIGHT at the end of the 8hr mark. I just make sure that I eat the calories based on the macros I need, within that 8hr time frame and then forget about it.]]></description>

That is amazing! Do you eat food as you usually would but in the 8 hour period? x]]></description>

Thank you. I have lost three pounds in my first week of trying IF. And it&#039;s honestly not been the hardship I expected! And this is from one who thought skipping breakfast would be the end of the world! ;)]]></description>

Not at all. It&#039;s an eating window, not a strict meal count. You&#039;re allowed to eat whenever during that time span. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this article very much and appreciate the straightforward way in which it&#039;s written. Thank you. One question, though:

I note that most of those using this system seem to eat only twice a day. I have managed the fasting until lunchtime, but struggle not to eat any snacks (fruit or raw veg, usually) in the afternoon - especially when my evening meal needs to be a bit later. Does this spoil the effect of the IF?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;m currently conducting daily version of intermittent fasting. Problem I&#039;m having is that I often exercise in the morning. I also sometimes do an hr of boxing from 12pm - 1pm and then grappling from 1-2pm. I usually eat breakfast on these days. I&#039;m not feeling some of the other versions. Suggestions please.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article James!

I&#039;ve been practicing Intermittent Fasting for several years now. I remember reading Martin Berkhans leangains website years ago and getting the idea for 16:8 protocol from him - mostly for weight management at first. However, I soon tried many different variations of IF and moved towards appreciating the health benefits.

Over the years I&#039;ve managed to add considerable amount of muscle mass, while losing noticeable fat mass thanks to IF. In-fact, I&#039;ve made so much progress I was even able to step on a bodybuilding stage. So much about not being able to gain muscle while fasting, hah. People just have a hard time accepting that you can omit food for most of the day and still make great progress.

But aside from helping me look good naked, IF helps me greatly by giving me incredible mental clarity during fasting. Great ability to focus and be productive. Hunger hasn&#039;t been an issue for years, not after my body adapted to it. 

As the years keep going by, more and more evidence keeps surfacing, promoting the potential health benefits of Intermittent Fasting and it further reinforces my approval of this great approach to nutrition.

I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve had such good results as well. Hopefully your success will get more people to try IF.]]></description>
