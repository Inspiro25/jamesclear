					<description><![CDATA[When I read this article, the bells, lights, and whistles went off in my head!!!

Now I truly understand why weight loss and healthy eating has been a struggle.  What I come away with is it&#039;s really a choice. Either I chose to continue being unhappy making unhealthy food choices or do something about it.

This is life changing for me and I thank you so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, Love your article as all of your articles are great. The &#039;Outer ring&#039; doesn&#039;t work in my household, because my husband eats totally different to me, we do shop together most times, however I do not find any shopping problems, because I plan out what I&#039;ll eat, and no matter how much I eat my weight is stable anyhow, so I feel this wonderful feeling of freedom, which is great. Thank you James for all your help and encouragement. (((hugs))) Heather-mae.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/simple-diet-ideas#comment-1799&quot;&gt;Christina Waldman&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Christina, I have been doing intermittent fasting for around three months now, I started on the 5:2, which is five days of eating normally and two non consecutive days of restricting myself to 500 calories per day, then I read about James Clear and the 18:6 method, which I have been doing now for the past month. I love it, I have absolutely know problems with it. I eat more then double what I would normally eat if I was not dieting,and my weight is completely stable. I have lot&#039;s of energy and I feel terrific. My experience that it&#039;s good for women as well. Heather-mae.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This makes more sense than anything I&#039;ve read, heard, etc.  I&#039;m so tired of the diet gurus that well you get it...the details are mind numbing and court disaster.

I really do also appreciate your straight common sense approach to doing, changing, etc.  Common sense is not so common.

Thanks for the challenges.]]></description>
