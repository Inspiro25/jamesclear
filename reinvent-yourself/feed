How inspiring... I agree with Varun, I salute you! Wow, and with 3 kids. You are the kind of nurse we want in our hospitals and the kind of mother we want all kids to have. The kind of friend anyone would be lucky to have.

Congratulations!]]></description>

I&#039;ve been bouncing for about 5 years now, still not assured about my current job.

What if you have been looking and trying different things for years but still are not near a place that you are doing what you love? How long does someone bounce around just existing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I can&#039;t be reminded enough that dreams aren&#039;t &quot;divinely inspired.&quot;  I&#039;ve wasted a lot of time in my life waiting for a stroke of inspiration, unbridled passion, or some other kind of extraordinary call towards something.  It&#039;s such a popular myth in our society.  But that&#039;s just not how it works!  Dreams are more like soft whispers combined with a decision to actually do the work.  I&#039;m only just now accepting that.  Thank you for such an enlightening story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/reinvent-yourself#comment-4490&quot;&gt;Kat&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Katherine,

Life is an ongoing series of choices.  We get to do anything we want, when we want to, and the end result is us experiencing the results of our choices.  There are no wrong choices only choices that lead us in different directions than we might have had we done something else.  

Opportunities come and go, and you are correct some never come again exactly the same way, but sometimes they are much worse or better than we can imagine.  The thing is you are experiencing what you are choosing.  You will learn from this.

One thing we have to learn is that others, whether parents, friends or lovers, show us life through their eyes and their needs to feel comfort and ease.  Be mind-ful of that. The choices they have made, would like to make or have been told should be made are sometimes a series of &quot;would&#039;a, should&#039;a, could&#039;a.  

It&#039;s up to you to make your decisions based on what feels comfortable and ease-ful for you. Your way may be hard or easy, you are choosing. I would also share with you that behind anger is fear.  Fear can be a tool for protection and/or stagnation, both are necessary to grow, provided you choose to use them that way.

I send you good wishes to be discerning and happy in your choices!

Joan Belle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my first comment since joining this community.  I&#039;m 41 years old, in the Navy and have just started reinventing myself.  James, wow!  Your content is so profound and yet so simple its awesome.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.  I&#039;m in the middle of Transform Your Habits and just wanted to share some thoughts.  I always wanted to be big and strong as a kid but never did anything about it...so much self doubt and fear.  But not anymore.  One of the ways I define myself now is a weight lifter who strength trains no less than 4 days a week.  I try to focus on that more so than the long term  (5 year) goals (bench 300, 21 inch arms, weigh 250 etc...)  All of them are reachable, but I&#039;ll get too side tracked if I don&#039;t focus on defining myself first; and making it a habit. I&#039;m in the 2nd month of a 9 month deployment in the Mediterranean so I&#039;m fortunate that I have time to make it a habit and time to really lift and get strong.  Now I have to really think about my life and decide how else I want to define myself.   That&#039;s really the hard part...deciding what you really want out of life and going for it.   But I did want to thank you for your content...you have a gift for teaching common sense, and you have a fellow Tarheel as a new fan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/reinvent-yourself#comment-4457&quot;&gt;Deborah&lt;/a&gt;.

Dear Deborah,

I have struggled with social norms all my life... a asian woman being brought up with traditional values and living in a western society. Another Agist social norm is the fact I have gone back to University at the age of 43! At times I have questioned my actions surrounded by 18 year olds.... but I have realised I am important and I should do what satisfies my soul and nurtures my spirit. So whether 43 or 62  our journey is the same.... I wish you luck in yours... listen to your heart. :-)]]></description>
