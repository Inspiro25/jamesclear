					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this insight -- just had an interesting conversation with my son in the midst of finals and hearing the stress in his voice I told him the lion tamer story and actually just shared the above article.

Thanks again.]]></description>

Lynne -- first, thanks for reading. It&#039;s great to have you in our community!

And good luck on the book editing. Pick one and go for it. You&#039;ll get to all of them eventually. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post.  So much of what you&#039;ve said rang true with my life and I&#039;m in my 50&#039;s.. Never too late to learn. I&#039;ve got 3 draft novels written over the past 3 years and whilst I wrote them one at a time you&#039;ve just made me realise I&#039;ve not committed to editing one. I&#039;m trying to do them all together. Madness. Many thanks, two will have to wait..  Which two though...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great article James (the photo was awesome too), it is amazing how when you focus your energy and attention to one task you also get clarity of thinking and better ways automatically become obvious. This is something I need to work on as often get distracted and end up doing several things at once. Keep up the good work.]]></description>
