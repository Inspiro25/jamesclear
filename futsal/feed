					<description><![CDATA[Since finding your site and receiving the newsletters,   I find I have to say that your perceptions and real experiences do resonate with me.  I save them in a folder named &quot;clarify,&quot;  which is just what they do.  

A lot of self-help in my opinion and  quest to change and grow, enlighten, elevate my thinking,  all of my natural resources, most of them are  &quot;babble speak&quot;  just not doing the meat and straightforward talking that one can relate to..In theory sure, we all have similar problems and concerns desires and intention for ourselves,  in a unique way. As a proliferation, a lot of these e zines,  books,  and courses, are  for those who want on the band wagon they fall short as in, you feel that the only thing this person wants by their blog ie newsletters is to make that money not to assist and to share.   

I&#039;ve tailored your topics to myself...They are easy to do.  I appreciate it.

					<description><![CDATA[Two points about your article stood out to me.

Speaking without slides:
&quot;I have some friends who are amazing storytellers. I’ve never been great at it, but I’d like to get better. The constraint I’ve placed on myself is scheduling talks without the use of slides. &quot;
-&#062; That&#039;s certainly a major departure from the norm. What sort of feedback have you received as a result of the different approach?

Learning from sports:
I&#039;m starting to train for my first run so it was interesting to see this example. Historically, I haven&#039;t had much interest in sports - your perspective is prompting me to rethink what I can learn from athletes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[dear james,

this is a great article. it hooked me from the beginning. and it is also very useful. i will try it out. i&#039;m a struggling artist (yes, one of those i&#039;m afraid) and i&#039;m now trying to learn internet marketing. i also made a constraint, i blog about once a week. i&#039;ve been doing that for about 16 weeks now. i have a mailchimp list of only 16 people! although one of them bought a calendar just last week. it&#039;s a tiny achievement. but now it&#039;s time to make another constraint to do with marketing ... and you answered my question perfectly here about that because i realized i have to get specific on one thing in marketing and do that. so i think i&#039;ll look for places to show my work on the net. i know there&#039;s a zillion other things to do but one by one right. thanks, I really needed this article. much appreciation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to you I think I have found a way for God to communicate with me in a language my brain understands.

He used a burning bush for Moses and James Clear for Charles.

God has Blessed you...

And me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article as always, James.

I observe that the same principle applies in the workplace. As one of the readers commented, added constraints can improve efficiency. I tend to achieve more at work when I&#039;m all-too-aware that the resources available for performing the task(s) are quite limited. It is then that I deploy focus, intensity, prioritization etc. The result? Enhanced efficiency, effectiveness and ultimately productivity. 

Thanks, once again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting! I&#039;ve always wondered about this but with a completely different thing. I used to be a hardcore gamer and I was wondering whether having lower or higher sensitivity on mouse and whether it&#039;s heavier or lighter would be better to train my hands. 

It&#039;s only recently that I found out that your brain undergoes changes after a great amount of practice. This is probably one of the most things I procrastinate on because of the excuse  I keep telling myself that being more efficient yields less time waste.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lately I have been having trouble getting through workouts. It seems that every time I reach a hard set, I give up and try to find excuses to quit. I know that my tendency to stop before I begin is all due to a mental weakness - and I hate myself for it. Have you written any articles on increasing one&#039;s mental toughness? I need some help. Thanks.]]></description>
