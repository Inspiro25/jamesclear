					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/exercise-habit#comment-11616&quot;&gt;Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Lindsay! I really appreciate that. And it&#039;s great to have you reading too!

p.s. That line, &quot;Many of our business problems are our personal problems in disguise,&quot; was actually from Michael Port, not me. But it&#039;s a good one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James!

I attended the Entrepreneurs Winning Strategies Conference this morning and loved it.  Unfortunately, I had to leave early and was unable to meet you and tell you how much I enjoy your articles.  One thing you said that was awesomely mind blowing was, &quot;Many of our business problems are our personal problems in disguise.&quot;  I think that is SO true.  I have gradually become lazier than I&#039;d like to admit in important areas of my life and work and look forward to establishing a habit first and worrying about the results later.  I know that once I implement habits into my life that the world will be my oyster!  Thank you for your great writing and perspective.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James! I have a proposition for you :). I found myself in need for advice on how to change aspects of my environment to make it work toward my goals and help establish new habits. I tried to come up with solutions myself but I need a fresh perspective. How much would you charge for helping me out?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot James for this great article.
This is one area of my life where I know I have to work that will have a tremendous impact in all my areas of my life.
But somehow I am not able to motivate myself to exercise daily.
I am right now based in the dessert working on a big petrochemical project,my work starts at 5:30 am in the morning until 6 pm, so you see I have to get up at 3:30 am in the morning to reach office site on time.
Once I come back I just get glued to the television and sleep early by 9.
I have one day week off on Friday.
Could you please suggest some action plan especially for me as I need to shed a few Kilograms as I am grossly overweight weighing 108 Kgs with height of 5 11&quot;.
I will be glad to receive your feedback and suggestions.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great article, James! 

In particular, your suggestion to develop a ritual to make exercise easier resonates with me. I think it&#039;s important to break down a ritual into a series for very simple pre-training steps. Here&#039;s an example:

I&#039;m a 4th degree Blackbelt in Karate (which means I&#039;ve been training consistently for a very long time). The ritual I start my pre-training ritual with is very simple: 

I iron my gi (karate suit). The next step is to put on my gi and tie my belt. Then I get into the car and drive to the karate dojo.  Once I&#039;m there, I get all excited about training. :-)

As you can see, I follow a ritual that consist of a series of simple steps - and I focus on each step (instead of thinking nervously about the full-on training ahead).]]></description>
