					<description><![CDATA[I can imagine the positive effect this would have clearly. I was thinking that I&#039;m a slow learned (2 years) and I feel bad that I&#039;m feeling less bad about it because I had this before you did.

Aside from that disgusting feeling, thanks for the article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Above my desk I have a quote from artist and writer William Morris: &quot;Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.&quot;  Your post made me reflect on the quote more deeply today.  Our &quot;houses&quot; are physical or virtual sites like our homes or offices; they are also our workout routines, our daily habits, our ways of eating, and our relationships.

Thanks for the reminder.  I always look forward to what you have to say.]]></description>

Even after being in business online for 16 years, it can be a handful.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

This is very valuable advice for anyone managing a website. Many blogs are so cluttered with distractions that I rarely make it to the end of the article. On yours, I made it all the way to the comments section without a single distraction. :-)

I agree with the principle that simplifying your workouts can give better results. I&#039;d just like to point out that there may be certain situations where it is better to do just the opposite. For long-distance runners who experience repeated running injuries, making workouts more complex by creating more variety and adding cross-training can be a preferable approach.

Thanks for the great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Minimalism is key for success. When we remove all the unnecessary things, we can reduce the visual stress and concentrate more on the actual things we required.

As usual, great post James :)]]></description>
