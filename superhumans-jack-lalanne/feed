					<description><![CDATA[JACK LALANNE, wasn&#039;t only a living legend but such a genuine, kind man. Thanks James for this wonderful article. I&#039;m only 35 yrs old but this guy is truly my favorite role model. I think of him every time I eat, and workout. Your article let me know a little bit more about the man I credit for keeping me in shape for the 20 yrs I&#039;ve been working out. But now I am gonna incorporate the 30 mins of swimming to my routine as well.  I work and open a health club 4 days a week, and I get up every morning and do my workout before my shift starts, its so true that having a routine keeps everything in order. Cause when your like me and you have two jobs, and two kids its hard to find the time to workout... but Jack&#039;s enthusiasm was so great, it gets me through each day &quot;happily&quot; ... Great Article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jack LaLanne was a force to be reckoned with. I&#039;ve been exercising for decades in a row, and I&#039;ve got alright strength.

How this man managed to get to 1000 push ups in 23 minutes is completely beyond me. I can hardly manage 100, let alone 1000.

I&#039;m asking myself whether these feats are achievable by everybody, or that some people simply have some amazing genetic treat that lets them pull stuff like this off.

Bruce Lee comes to mind as well. Did he and LaLanne luck out in the genetic lottery, or am I missing something in my own training?


Sincerely,

Barry]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He was one in a billion and I still can see him with the German Shapards doing the exercises with the chair. His was a unique life, not matched by any others that I know about. I unfortunately don&#039;t have his drive, but try and do a little better each  day. It is so easy to quit and let the fat overtake us. Particularly as we get older, or I should say as I get older, it gets easier to sit than walk. We all know what we should do and what is the correct thing to do, but we get weak and take the easier path. Sort of like the Washington D.C. Pols. Anyways thanks for the article and keep on truckin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jack LaLanne was, is and always will be a &quot;living Legend&quot;. Thanks so much for submitting this wonderful article about a true man, and workout warrior! He will be forever missed for his greatness. Workout everyday, and diet with just 2 meals not 6-7 meals a day... sounds good to me. God Bless.]]></description>
