					<description><![CDATA[As with all people we have complicated lives with many strings pulling you in many directions. One barrier to accomplishements for me is my inability to say no and be stingy with my time to others. I find myself bouncing around like a wild man doing everything for others but missing things I should be doing. I was told that saying &quot;NO&quot; can be refreshing and that I should practice it more often, maybe that is where I will start. James Clear you have good influence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are so many things I would like to do well. The frustration-cost of attempting to do all of them -- even in small bites like you suggest -- seems so completely out of my nature that I inevitably self-sabotage in a matter of days. What are they? Play an instrument, prepare for a show, write jokes, write a book, work out, ride a bicycle, spend time with spouse quietly on the couch, read books and articles, listen to audiobooks, write a newsletter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for allowing me to be a member of your community, which I&#039;ve joined today. I have already read your article on procrastination (&quot;using the Seinfield Strategy&quot;) which thought me a lot, as I have one or two false starts. I am pretty sure I can gain the route to start again and, as you say, &quot;don&#039;t break the chain&quot;.
