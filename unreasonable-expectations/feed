					<description><![CDATA[Well said Penelope!

I also enjoyed this article.

I personally had a very similar experience to the experiment conducted by Robert Rosenthal. When I got into high school (9 grade), I remember my math teacher one day, out of the blue, saying &quot;Don&#039;t you dare show your face if you don&#039;t get a perfect score from your final math exam&quot; -- this was absurd and illogical because at the time I was mediocre at best.

But it stuck with such a strong emotional anchor that four years later I was more than happy to show my face lol

Anyway, back to the article,

You&#039;re tackling a really huge topic here and expressed seriously interesting ideas.

I, personally, try to approach this rather simplistically - go as big as I can commit to, but make sure I  am pushing my comfort zones.

In other words...

If I know, from the start, how to achieve this goal (or if I feel fully comfortable along the way), I set my expectations too low. On the other hand, if I longer believe it&#039;s achievable, it&#039;s too high.

From that moment, a goal is just a road marking at the destination and it&#039;s the ride that matters :) I know this sounds romanticized and yes, it is quite harder to implement in life and there are moments of doubt and the &quot;I want it now!&quot; thoughts, but they pass.

Ahhh, damn, it&#039;s a real pleasure to discuss topics like this! Really glad you didn&#039;t remove this article.

Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A very good post. It&#039;s not easy to walk along the line between pushing oneself and making the most of small, incremental gains. It takes experience and good judgement. (Or, as someone once said: &quot;Good judgement comes from making mistakes. Making mistakes is part of experience, which includes the experience of making bad judgements.&quot; So stay teachable, and keep making mistakes, but don&#039;t get totally downhearted about it. Sounds easy - it&#039;s actually quite difficult. I think one gets better at it with age - assuming one has stayed teachable.]]></description>
