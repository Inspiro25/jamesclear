					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much! This was written very nicely and it helped me with my speech. I learned so many things that I didn&#039;t know and how they work.

Thanks again! I rate it 10/5. :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time I was getting salty chips into my mouth I spotted it out. Yuk, you can taste the fat and over salted whatever however this is not good potatoes...

Try instead ye old Slovak recepies:

Bake whole potatoes in oven for 40 minutes at 150 Celsius and then take a bit of butter and put on top of the hot potato. And sour milk to it ... yummy. :) 

Thanks for sharing by the way. A great article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that having junk and fatty foods are really unhealthy to you and I. That is why  I think that there should be taxes on them. Because obesity has reached at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/junk-food-science#comment-5454&quot;&gt;Stephen Guise&lt;/a&gt;.

This is very useful information. We actually just need to train ourselves to eat healthy. Spicing our health, whole meal foods makes our meals also attractive, with good aroma, taste and full of nutrients for healthy lives. Let&#039;s eat healthy. Let&#039;s have healthy eating habits and will not crave junk foods.

Kind regards,

Priscilla]]></description>
