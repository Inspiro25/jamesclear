					<description><![CDATA[Wow... what a wonderful message.  I found you, James, because I read a post on Rebelle Society that you wrote about Dr. Suess and I loved it.  I just finished reading The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.  It seems to be a recurring theme in my life right now. Don&#039;t give up the dream.  Your writing style is very personable.  I like it a lot and I thank you for sharing these thoughts. As they spoke a truth into my heart that just keeps confirming... DON&#039;T ever give up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am moving temporarily to another country for work leaving my husband behind. We have agreed it is for the best (no household income for some time now) and we will see each other etc. Twice I should have been on a plane but HR haven&#039;t got the paperwork sorted. Each of those days and on other days I have become so anxious, horrible sick feelings. I want to be able to accept my situation and not let these debilitating emotions override the good stuff. I do all the usual stuff, Tai Chi, breathing etc. How do I learn to accept what is?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Thank you so much for your articles! I always enjoy reading them.

I recently stumbled upon this quote and it is my new motivation for this year:

“If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough.” -― Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

Your article really resonated with that quote and just reinforced everything you said.

Keep up the great work!!! :)]]></description>

Hi Rose -- have you tried to hook up w/ any college classes that do permaculture? There is a LOT of interest in it among some of the college age folks -- and they have energy too! There are also online certificates in it, I believe. Hugs, from a fellow gardener/orchardist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/uncertain#comment-7397&quot;&gt;Tina Lear&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Tina,

Sorry for the confusion. I definitely could have explained that better. Yes, my first business idea flopped. I have started many others since then, some of which have paid for my lifestyle the last 3+ years. 

Tn story number one, the man I met decided not to go because he faced fear, uncertainty, and self-doubt. In story number two, I was simply trying to say that I get what he is feeling and I also understand how hard it can be to work through those things and make the dream a reality. In some cases, you&#039;ll fall flat on your face (like I did with my first business idea). However, and this is the point of the whole article, if you&#039;re willing to embrace that uncertainty, see the failures and setbacks as an opportunity for growth rather than a defining result, then you can work through the difficulties, master your own psychology and make it work.

Bottom line: fear strikes all of us, working through it isn&#039;t easy, but it is possible. 

I was just hoping to share the lessons learned from my own experience. Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James -- uncertainty, fear, or whatever moniker you want to give the feeling has paralyzed so many and allowed greatness in the form of projects, symphonies, songs, ideas and inventions to lie dormant within them.  This article is SOOOOOO on point and speaks to what I have wrestled with for over a decade.  Thanks man for having the courage to continue to take steps in a direction that you feel is right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to move to another county to live and work for several years.
