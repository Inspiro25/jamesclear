					<description><![CDATA[What an incredible post. I found myself nodding along and getting more excited about the prospect of it all as I was reading through it. I&#039;m a new reader and wanted to thank you for writing this. It put into words the things that have been running through my mind for quite awhile. So, thank you!]]></description>

Agreed. Thanks for sharing, Nate.

As you say, there are benefits and drawbacks of each. I doubt you&#039;ll find many people who are great at all three, but I believe there are certain ways to limit the downsides of each.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it, Reema.

And I totally agree with you. I&#039;ve always been an explorer and whenever I get out into the world (and away from my screen), I&#039;m always happy I did.

					<description><![CDATA[Their are typically 3 kinds of people. The dwellers, doers and dreamers. The dwellers focus on past experiences, the doers live in the moment and the dreamers dream. As you said it&#039;s about living, not merely being alive. I think if we can all be each one of these people we will be much better off. A lot of &quot;want to be entrepreneurs&quot; are to often stuck in the dreaming phase and never get into the actionable steps as a doer would. Their are flaws in each and if we can combine each we mitigate the flaws and focus on each ones strengths. Thanks for sharing. Keep on, keeping on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A thoughtful post, especially when we are about to enter a new year. :) 

I liked the connection and exploration part. These days the more everything is available a click away the more we forget the importance of &quot;live&quot; experience, be it humans or surroundings!]]></description>
