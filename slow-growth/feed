					<description><![CDATA[This is really good. I never thought about just taking my time with things. I was so focused on reaching my goal weight that I forgot to enjoy working out. I just wanted to hurry up and get the end so that I could enjoy the benefits there after. Our country is built on getting everything fast and easy, with as little hard work as possible. It&#039;s so hard to change a whole nation&#039;s mindset, especially when the media is telling us to get it as fast as we can.]]></description>

Lynne -- thanks for sharing. Your experiences with swimming are a great example of slow growth and a successful long-term approach.

p.s. Feel free to share your experiences here anytime. That&#039;s what makes our community so great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t put my head under water when I swam and only swam breastroke.  In my late 30&#039;s I taught myself to swim front crawl 5 minutes at a time, twice a week, for two years. I enjoyed every minute and now people think I must have learnt when I was young. Great post, lots of important lessons for us all, thank-you.]]></description>

Henri -- great to hear from you. I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the post.

p.s. No surprise that you didn&#039;t know about this site yet. It&#039;s only 12 weeks old, but we&#039;ve already got a great community here. This will be the platform for my life&#039;s work. You can expect to hear a lot more from me here. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled upon here via Twitter. Didn&#039;t even know you had another blog.

You&#039;re right on with this post. This is something I&#039;ve discovered the hard way. I&#039;ve strived for results, and it&#039;s agonizing to want to be somewhere you&#039;re not.

Nowadays, I do my best to enjoy the present moment. I do what I love, and what brings happiness to my life right now. 

I follow my heart (and my passion) and the rest just seems to fall into place with time. There&#039;s no need to force things, but instead simply play and do your best.

At least that&#039;s what I&#039;ve learned.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/slow-growth#comment-314&quot;&gt;cj&lt;/a&gt;.

CJ -- great example and I love the dedication. 

The funny thing? 3 months seems annoyingly long before you start and remarkably short after you&#039;ve done it.

p.s. Thanks for reading. It&#039;s great to have you here.]]></description>
