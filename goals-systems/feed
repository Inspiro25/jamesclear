					<description><![CDATA[&quot;For a minute or two, I thought about doing my final set. Then, I reminded myself that I plan to do this for the rest of my life and decided to call it a day.&quot;

So, what you&#039;re actually saying is that doing this for the rest of your life is your long-term goal, and you&#039;re staying focused on that instead of being distracted by potential short-term goals.

You&#039;ve argued persuasively, then, for the value of long-term goals over short-term goals:

1) You&#039;ve committed to a process that serves your long-term goals.
2) Your focus on the long term releases you from looking for immediate short-term results.
3) Feedback loops help you make adjustments that keep your processes pointed toward your long-term goals.

Yes, systems are good for actually making progress. But you can&#039;t really measure &quot;progress&quot; without some kind of goal that you&#039;re either getting closer to or further away from.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for sharing this! I am so happy that I finally understand even more what it means to focus on the process and not on the result. I am happy and thankful to learn something new today. I am excited to share this to my team. But I am more excited to apply this to myself first. Thank you! You are so blessed. May God continue to bless the works of your hands!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great piece. I recently decided to make progress to better myself rather than set precise goals. I wasn&#039;t 100% sure as to the actual process but after reading this article I do believe that I am on the right path and that it is essential that I have a system which I stick with.

It&#039;s always nice to hear/read someone else&#039;s perspective and their experiences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The reason I stumbled upon your site is because I decided to impose some strict but achievable goals on myself recently, I&#039;ve stuck with some but others are flagging somewhat, and already circumstances have changed and so my goals will have to as well ...and it just seems to send them further away. It&#039;s quite demoralizing!

In actual fact I&#039;d much rather focus on the system and therefore the tasks I need to do daily, weekly etc, rather than what the exact end result will be or has to be. So in short, thanks for flipping this around it helped a lot! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I could disagree with an article more:

Goals reduce your current happiness.
Goals don&#039;t define my happiness. In fact, happiness is fleeting. I choose to have Joy.  Goals give me a target.

Goals are strangely at odds with long-term progress.
If this is you, then you aren&#039;t planning properly.  You need 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, 10 year, 20 year goals etc, etc.

Goals suggest that you can control things that you have no control over.
Yes, I can predict the future, I do it every day. If I decide I&#039;m going to grow my business by 10%, then I&#039;m going to grow my business by 10%. Where ever you put your focus is where you see results.  Using my example, if I focus on growing my business, I&#039;ll talk to people about it, read books about it, watch videos about it and it will happen. Improving my systems will be a side effect of focusing on my goal. 

By focusing merely on systems you risk only focusing on the problems with your systems. Guess what? Your systems will NEVER be PERFECT so you could end up focusing on the &quot;how&quot; and never focusing on &quot;what&#039;s next?&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, this is well and truly awesome. For me it was the eye-opener of the century.  I&#039;m a self-confessed goal achiever, proud of the phrase I coined when still in my teens, &quot;I don&#039;t have dreams, I have goals&quot;. S**t. It feels like I&#039;ve spent the last 50 years of my life chasing tails. Oh gosh. Never mind. There&#039;s always tomorrow, I suppose. :-)

THANKS!]]></description>
