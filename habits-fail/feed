					<description><![CDATA[Thank you... from someone who didn&#039;t know where to start making positive and lasting changes.

In my little writer&#039;s group I was asked what primary resolution I would make this year and how I would attain it. There were so many needs tugging at me I didn&#039;t know where to start. Because of my husband&#039;s hospital stay I started with nutrition. I gathered healthy new recipes I downloaded from the internet.  I am trying them out one by one. I am saving those we like in a three-ring binder that will eventually become my go-to cook book.

My 1% principle involves planning, shopping, preparation, cooking, serving and cleanup. Eventually this process will relieve stress and make the process more enjoyable.

My husband being in the hospital 6 days over Christmas with blood clots and heart/lung disease gave me the impetus. Eating there for so long changed my husband&#039;s eating habits. I jumped on it!  Praise the Lord!

Now I just have to remember the 1% principle.  Thank you for your wise coaching and generosity.  I am saving the articles as PDFs.   They are so encouraging! (I could write my New Year&#039;s resolution now. Ha!)

					<description><![CDATA[James, I support 110% of every word in this post. 

It&#039;s the most comprehensive and perfect (nothing to take off) post on habits that worth giving everyone who wants to change their lives.

You know what? This is the exact process I used to:

- Read 150 books last year.
- Meditate for 120 days already.
- Take cold showers everytime. 
- Eating my frog habit (1 week in. :) Feeling good.)
- Sustain my sleep pattern (in the process).

I would like to say that success rate for this process is ~90%-100% (vs 80-90% fail rate for average), so basically it&#039;s the huge difference. The key is patience.

Thank you very much for your writing. It definitely influenced and changed my life. 

Have a great day and give MORE strategic content. :)

David.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James

I really like your problem no 5. Small changes do add up if you give them a chance.

I am working on a big writing project this year and have decided to tackle it by writing for 20 minutes 5 days a week. I might not achieve many words in that time but cumulatively, the word count is growing and I am already seeing the results.

I would encourage anyone to give small changes a try

					<description><![CDATA[Great as always James! I can attest to the fact that a Keystone habit can make all the difference. About a year ago I started &quot;My Morning Blastoff.&quot; It&#039;s pretty much a series of events that get me in the zone for whatever the day holds. It has been so effective my accountability partner can notice without me saying, whether or not I did it for the day. It&#039;s also been a great way for me to build new habits because I just attach them to the Morning Blastoff. Thanks for all the tips &#038; hope all is well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits-fail#comment-13979&quot;&gt;Ruth Cooke&lt;/a&gt;.

Great advice here, James, and it makes perfect sense!  We all think we have to go big or go home... but what ends up happening is that we just go home.  Like the resolution to lose 50 pounds stat!  We obsess over calories and exercise for 2 hours/day for a week, then we&#039;re so burnt out we can&#039;t bring ourselves to try again.  

This year, I want exercise to be a built-in habit for me.  So I&#039;m committed to exercising every single day.  I set my goal at 20 minutes per day (although now I&#039;m wishing I would have just said 5 minutes and built on that....)  Some days I lift weights, other days I go for a run, but every day I know it must be done, and since I&#039;m not also trying to eat healthier, lose tons of pounds, or anything else, it&#039;s not so hard to do it.  It&#039;s not overwhelming, and I can&#039;t wait to see how great I&#039;ll feel by the end of the year when daily exercise has become an ingrained habit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits-fail#comment-13966&quot;&gt;Bruce Harpham&lt;/a&gt;.

Don&#039;t use an &quot;empty number&quot; to track your success. Yes, email subscibers is an indicator for success, but no guarantee.

If you want to get rich, being a follower is enough. Following guides and following blueprints will do the trick. But if you want to move something you need to be a student. You have to think yourself.

Choose a number that gives you peace of mind. That could be having 200$ in your pocket at all times. That could be having 10k in the bank. That could be having your own house. That could be having 50 comments on each of your blogposts. That could be anything weird.

Don&#039;t try to sell your soul to make money, just to buy your soul back in the end.

You can use popups, selling psychology, 5 offers to join an email-list on every page, or whatever &quot;experts&quot; tell you to do. But you always have to ask the question: Do i want others do this to me?

Yes i&#039;m drunk. Yes this is going offtopic. Yes this is weird. But posting this gives me peace of mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this, James! I signed up for B.J. Fogg&#039;s Tiny Habit program. It is indeed free, and a new session starts every Monday.

I&#039;ve made every mistake on this list, multiple times. But each time I try and fail, I get closer to succeeding. Focussing on only one area or habit at a time has to be my biggest problem, as with so many life areas that need improvement, I tend to try and work on multiple things at once. B.J.&#039;s Tiny Habit program may be just what I need to help me succeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to say that I started reading your blog last New Year when someone posted your &#039;dont&#039; have goals&#039; article on Facebook. From there, your blog became one of my favorite ways to consistently refocus my energy this year. I really appreciate the bi-weekly reminders to apply these simple, thoughtful concepts to my life and work, and I have also enjoyed sharing your ideas with the people around me. 

More specifically, I took your advice all year, not to have goals but to focus instead on setting up processes and letting them run their course, whatever that may be. It was very scary to do this, because this year was my final semester of doctoral coursework (orals, comps, dissertation), and I was simultaneously working full time and running an organization. I started the year not knowing how I was going to get everything done (focusing on goals would have completely sunk me), but instead, I just got up and worked in a specific way every day, and trusted that it would all work out. I just wanted to tell you: It did work out! While it was intensely difficult, it would have been completely impossible if I hadn&#039;t changed my mindset about how to make progress.

Thanks for this wonderful, positive, authentic blog! As we move into 2015, I&#039;m grateful to be part of this community.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A perfect post to start the New Year!  I think your fourth problem resonates with me the most.  Our environment can be extremely important.  In my case, I&#039;m surrounded by certain people that are not encouraging of new positive work habits so I am looking to make some changes.  

Moreover, in order to become more focused (huge resolution of mine), I must limit the number of distractions during work hours.  This means cell phone in another room, Self-Control app installed on Macbook, and closing the office door when doing most important tasks.]]></description>
