					<description><![CDATA[Mine is fitness.  Every time things are not going well, I have not been exercising. When I do, right away my eating gets cleaner, I take my vitamins, I drink water, I go to sleep earlier, I dress better (because I feel better), I even keep up with my daily journaling, etc.

Exercising for me is a major keystone. I never knew what that was until I read it here.

Thank you. You rock!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been a huge fan of keystone habits since reading &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; last year.

My favorite, all-purpose keystone habit is Gratitude. When you’re grateful for what you have, your thoughts and actions help you get more of it. 

Because I work for myself, I&#039;ve found these 3 keystone habits helped grow my business:

1) Reading my monthly goal out loud for 1 minute every morning
2) Visualizing the &quot;WHY&quot; behind my goal for 3 minutes
3) Walking while saying affirmations for 10 minutes

Keystone habits may be small, but the changes they produce are BIG.

I wish you all the best!

					<description><![CDATA[When I get up at 5:00 A.M. and walk with the dog, do 25 minutes with a yoga DVD at 5:30, cook breakfast for me and the wife at 6:00, then got the the YMCA and swim for half an hour, I&#039;m walking around feeling like I have a completely new life! These were the keystone habits that I worked out without the help of a great psychologist. I called them &quot;The health list of things to do.&quot; I can actually feel the chemicals cascading in the brain. What a wonderful way to live.  I don&#039;t always do the health list, but now seeing so much written about it I will do it with more confidence. 

Thank you.]]></description>

Lucy -- your meditation practice is a great example of a keystone habit. Thanks for sharing. 

And you&#039;re right ... sometimes the pain of not sticking to a habit is the perfect reminder to get back on track.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting article James - I would say my keystone habit is sitting to meditate every day - I find that if I miss it everything just starts feeling &#039;off&#039;. I usually make the time to sit for 20 minutes every evening. Sometimes however, I seem to find more &#039;important&#039; things to do, like watch an extra hour of tv.... And this has a knock-on effect with my sleep etc. Perhaps  sometimes we need to see that effect of NOT sticking to our keystone habit to appreciate the power it actually has.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/keystone-habits#comment-108&quot;&gt;Jennifer Ayoub&lt;/a&gt;.

Jennifer -- I love the idea of finding your keystone habit and putting it into practice for the New Year. You&#039;ve shifted the focus from &quot;get result X&quot; to &quot;take action Y each day&quot;. 

That&#039;s a small, but powerful shift. If you figure out your keystone habits, then the results will fall into place automatically. 

Stop back and let us know how it goes. We would love to hear about your progress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/keystone-habits#comment-107&quot;&gt;Garry Stafford&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s true. There are certain choices we make (I think they may be somewhat different for each person) that can dictate the way we act (and react) to our surroundings and whatever else we are faced with.

Thanks for sharing your experiences, Garry. I&#039;m glad to have you as part of the community.]]></description>

Hmm... keystone habits for failure. That&#039;s an interesting idea. I&#039;ll have to spend some time on that one, but I think your basic idea is spot on.

Thanks for reading, Darius.]]></description>
