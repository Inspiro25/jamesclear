					<description><![CDATA[A couple of strategies that work for me...

1. If, say, I&#039;m making a sandwich for lunch at home, I put all the ingredients away before I start eating. That greatly reduces the temptation to make a second sandwich after I&#039;ve eaten the first.

2. If I still desire more food, I go and brush my teeth and rinse with Listerine for a full two minutes. That pretty much clears my palate and removes the lingering desire for more food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A lot of people have no idea what constitutes healthy food. 

I have to shamelessly link people to my Ultimate Food Guide, which happens to be one of  the most popular articles on my site.

Glad to see you&#039;re still writing James, been a while since you&#039;ve been on my podcast.

Take care,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to point out that the effect of the image on No. 3 is reversed if you tilt the image 90 deg. i.e. It is more likely an effect of the line being &quot;partitioned&quot; into two, than whether it was vertical or horizontal. This was pointed out by a commenter Thomas on the Summertomato page.

That said, I&#039;m not trying to negate your point about tall glasses, but the proof didn&#039;t seem quite valid. Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article!

Another thing that works really well is not having the serving dishes on the dinner table. Instead leave them in the kitchen. People are more reluctant to get up and get a second serving of food from the kitchen! This trick helps you eat less and works great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great tips!  We&#039;ve implemented the smaller plates at our house as well with great success.

Also -- I still don&#039;t believe you the horizontal and vertical lines are same size! Ha.

Thanks for the post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess that spreading food thin on a flat plate might help as well. I struggle with a somewhat opposite problem, you see, and a big (some would argue...) round bowl helps me to ensure that I get enough food for a meal. So, leaving some nuts on my desk seems like a great idea, too :).

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, James. These are very simple rules anyone can follow. Agree with all 10. One of this strategies works well in my family. My teenage boys are always in a &quot;munch&quot; mood. So, I wash, slice, cut and peel fruits and veggies, and put them in the fridge in a clear plastic container. These colorful and healthy assortment always catches their eye. I make sure I have a bowl of cut-up fruits and veggies with homemade dip, and some other healthy snack ready for the family movie night. This is very simple, just requires thinking ahead a bit. My friends tried a simple trick that was very effective: instead of putting pots and bowls with the food on the dinner table, they would leave them on the kitchen counter. Everybody would fill their plates and go sit down at the table. They said, they rarely went back for seconds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great thoughts on healthy food habits! I would like to add some more habits in this list.

1. We should not watch TV or read anything while having our food.
2. Instead of having food three times a day, we can split into five times per day.

Your insights on these tips is much appreciated.]]></description>
