					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/health-benefits-entrepreneurship#comment-1575&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

James,

Thank you for your reply and am sorry about my delay.  Although I received a notification from this site, my mailer categorized it as a junk mail (without my intention).  

Yes, online teaching is global and has a potential.  It also has difficulties, such as that you would need to compete with Philippine teachers who work for very low wages.  

Anyway, I don&#039;t think my teaching job will die, because all it needs is my being healthy.  I will keep trying as long as I want to. 

Again, thank you so much for your articles and your reply.

Chitoku]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article James! REALLY great. I agree - totally a mindset thing. Since I became my own boss I&#039;ve rarely been sick. I think it&#039;s a combo of how much happier I am creating my own destiny and also just sheer necessity because I can&#039;t afford to get sick!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/health-benefits-entrepreneurship#comment-871&quot;&gt;Chitoku Teshima&lt;/a&gt;.

Chitoku -- have you thought about taking your skills online? Think about how many non-native English speakers would love to speak English as well as you do. You&#039;re the perfect role model for them. 

You could create an online course that teaches students how to speak beautiful English as a non-native speaker. I feel like tons of people would be interested in that. It would also allow you to sell it for a relatively low price (maybe a few hundred dollars) but still get the benefit of scale and reach. 

Yes, you would have to learn a lot about online marketing and so on... but it would help you bypass all of the problems with the Japanese system.

Just a thought! Good luck and keep up the hard work! Don&#039;t give up on yourself.

And thanks for taking the time to read. It&#039;s great to have you in our little community!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/health-benefits-entrepreneurship#comment-957&quot;&gt;Hong Lee&lt;/a&gt;.

Hong -- thanks for sharing. I&#039;m glad you&#039;re enjoying the articles. I&#039;ll do my best to keep great information coming your way.

As far as becoming an entrepreneur, it&#039;s a tough road (as you already know). That said, I think you can definitely make &lt;em&gt;some version&lt;/em&gt; of your dream a reality. If running a clinic stresses you out to no end, but you want to be working on your own ... then why not build a platform online and see if you can coach and treat your own clients (either virtually or simply use the online platform to drive your client work in the real world). That would drastically reduce overhead and expenses while also giving you the freedom to work on your own.

That&#039;s just one idea. The point here is that you have many options at your disposal for becoming an entrepreneur. They all require hard work, but if you really want to be self&#8211;employed, then there is no reason you can&#039;t do that. I&#039;d spend some time thinking about the different options, brainstorming possible businesses (even if they seem far fetched at first), and considering how you can design your life to provide more fulfillment at work without sacrificing your personal health.

Hope that helps! And, as always, thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I enjoyed your article on entrepreneurship and health.  I would like to read more articles  on tactics to get started with your own business.  I am a Chiropractor and have had been an entrepreneur in some ways.  In my previous job, I was the clinic director for a brand new clinic with many responsibilities.  Everything from marketing, training, and patient care.  The setup I had was to build up the clinic to where it was producing and I would buy out the investors.  That experience was not healthy for me; I eventually burned out! I invested many hours in getting that clinic up and running.  There were certain factors I had no control over such as the overhead expenses and the billing department which affected my production.  Eventually I decided to leave because my hopes of owning that clinic was gone.  

Now I&#039;m in another job where I just treat patients so I can spend most of my time without the stress of running a business to rebuild my health -- mind, body, and spirit.  I&#039;m loving it, but something inside of my wants to have my own clinic some day.  But, some days I think to myself &quot;Why should I deal with all that stress? Why not just make a decent income, live within my means, and focus on my health and happiness?&quot; 

What are your thoughts? Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been an entrepreneur in a sense for 3 years or so.  I teach English as a foreign language.  

Basically, there are two different markets for English lessons here in Japan.  One is for students to prepare for college entrance exams.  Students memorizes a lot about English, no matter if that&#039;s practical or not. I am not interested in making them do that.

 The other market is of what they call &quot;conversational&quot; English, which is supposed to be practical.  The teachers on this market are mostly native in English.  I&#039;m not.  Besides, Japanese people believe being native in a language automatically makes you good at teaching the language you speak.  What&#039;s even worse is that those running schools with the native teachers are Japanese who just want to make money, which means the teachers are not paid much. They usually make less than what they need to raise their children, and that forces independent teachers to keep their prices low.

These are the things I learned after I started teaching independently.  Things are very slow in my business.  I don&#039;t believe fighting the ignorance in this local society will do me any good, as it was no good to Buckminster Fuller.  My money doesn&#039;t allow me to advertise my business, either.

Although I still love teaching, and do agree with what you say about being an entrepreneur, I feel I&#039;m lost.  Would you make me any suggestions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article: it makes compete sense to me. I started my own practice as a result of healing myself from years of serious ill health through alternative methods that I now offer to my clients, so I really see the link between improved health and entrepreneurship! I remember thinking: &quot;Now that I am in charge of my own survival and physical thriving, I can do anything!&quot; It is the attitude that you speak of.

The other obvious points for me are that: 
- I set myself hours that are optimum for my body rhythm,
- I can take a day off BEFORE I get sick instead of being in bed for 3 days
- I love my job so it does get me out of bed happy every day (which is proven to boost the immune system)
- I build walks into my day, breaks when I need them, long healthy lunches etc.

I believe that running my own business has been the key to staying healthy over the long term, yes, absolutely! I am so glad it is now backed up by research!]]></description>
