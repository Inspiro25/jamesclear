										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometime in the late 1800s—nobody is quite sure exactly when—a man named Vilfredo Pareto was fussing about in his garden when he made a small but interesting discovery.</p>
<p>Pareto noticed that a tiny number of pea pods in his garden produced the majority of the peas.</p>
<p>Now, Pareto was a very mathematical fellow. He worked as an economist and one of his lasting legacies was turning economics into a science rooted in hard numbers and facts. Unlike many economists of the time, Pareto&#8217;s papers and books were filled with equations. And the peas in his garden had set his mathematical brain in motion.</p>
<p>What if this unequal distribution was present in other areas of life as well?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="855" class="aligncenter wp-image-24991 size-full" src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/vilfredo-pareto-1870s-e1505330818146.jpg" alt="Vilfredo Pareto" /></p>
<h2>The Pareto Principle</h2>
<p>At the time, Pareto was studying wealth in various nations. As he was Italian, he began by analyzing the distribution of wealth in Italy. To his surprise, he discovered that approximately 80 percent of the land in Italy was owned by just 20 percent of the people. Similar to the pea pods in his garden, most of the resources were controlled by a minority of the players.</p>
<p>Pareto continued his analysis in other nations and a pattern began to emerge. For instance, after poring through the British income tax records, he noticed that approximately 30 percent of the population in Great Britain earned about 70 percent of the total income. <a href="#footnote-1-24687" id="note-1-24687" rel="footnote">1</a></p>
<p>As he continued researching, Pareto found that the numbers were never quite the same, but the trend was remarkably consistent. The majority of rewards always seemed to accrue to a small percentage of people. This idea that a small number of things account for the majority of the results became known as the Pareto Principle or, more commonly, the 80/20 Rule. <a href="#footnote-2-24687" id="note-2-24687" rel="footnote">2</a></p>
<h2>Inequality, Everywhere</h2>
<p>In the decades that followed, Pareto&#8217;s work practically became gospel for economists. Once he opened the world&#8217;s eyes to this idea, people started seeing it everywhere. And the 80/20 Rule is more prevalent now than ever before.</p>
<p>For example, through the 2015-2016 season in the National Basketball Association, 20 percent of franchises have won 75.3 percent of the championships. Furthermore, just two franchises—the Boston Celtics and the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/career-best-effort">Los Angeles Lakers</a>—have won nearly half of all the championships in NBA history. Like Pareto&#8217;s pea pods, a few teams account for the majority of the rewards. <a href="#footnote-3-24687" id="note-3-24687" rel="footnote">3</a></p>
<p>The numbers are even more extreme in soccer. While 77 different nations have competed in the World Cup, just three countries—Brazil, Germany, and Italy—have won 13 of the first 20 World Cup tournaments.</p>
<p>Examples of the Pareto Principle exist in everything from real estate to income inequality to tech startups. In the 1950s, three percent of Guatemalans owned 70 percent of the land in Guatemala. In 2013, 8.4 percent of the world population controlled 83.3 percent of the world&#8217;s wealth. In 2015, one search engine, Google, received 64 percent of search queries. <a href="#footnote-4-24687" id="note-4-24687" rel="footnote">4</a><a href="#footnote-5-24687" id="note-5-24687" rel="footnote">5</a><a href="#footnote-6-24687" id="note-6-24687" rel="footnote">6</a></p>
<p>Why does this happen? Why do a few people, teams, and organizations enjoy the bulk of the rewards in life? To answer this question, let&#8217;s consider an example from nature.</p>
<h2>The Power of Accumulative Advantage</h2>
<p>The Amazon rainforest is one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. Scientists have cataloged approximately 16,000 different tree species in the Amazon. But despite this remarkable level of diversity, researchers have discovered that there are approximately 227 “hyperdominant” tree species that make up nearly half of the rainforest. Just 1.4 percent of tree species account for 50 percent of the trees in the Amazon. <a href="#footnote-7-24687" id="note-7-24687" rel="footnote">7</a></p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Imagine two plants growing side by side. Each day they will compete for sunlight and soil. If one plant can grow just a little bit faster than the other, then it can stretch taller, catch more sunlight, and soak up more rain. The next day, this additional energy allows the plant to grow even more. This pattern continues until the stronger plant crowds the other out and takes the lion’s share of sunlight, soil, and nutrients.</p>
<p>From this advantageous position, the winning plant has a better ability to spread seeds and reproduce, which gives the species an even bigger footprint in the next generation. This process gets repeated again and again until the plants that are slightly better than the competition dominate the entire forest.</p>
<p>Scientists refer to this effect as &#8220;accumulative advantage.&#8221; What begins as a small advantage gets bigger over time. One plant only needs a slight edge in the beginning to crowd out the competition and take over the entire forest.</p>
<h2>Winner-Take-All Effects</h2>
<p>Something similar happens in our lives.</p>
<p>Like plants in the rainforest, humans are often competing for the same resources. Politicians compete for the same votes. Authors compete for the same spot at the top of the best-seller list. Athletes compete for the same gold medal. Companies compete for the same potential client. Television shows compete for the same hour of your attention.</p>
<p>The difference between these options can be razor thin, but the winners enjoy massively outsized rewards.</p>
<p>Imagine two women swimming in the Olympics. One of them might be 1/100th of a second faster than the other, but she gets all of the gold medal. Ten companies might pitch a potential client, but only one of them will win the project. You only need to be a little bit better than the competition to secure all of the reward. Or, perhaps you are applying for a new job. Two hundred candidates might compete for the same role, but being just slightly better than other candidates earns you the entire position.</p>
<blockquote><p>Situations in which small differences in performance lead to outsized rewards are known as Winner-Take-All Effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>These situations in which small differences in performance lead to outsized rewards are known as Winner-Take-All Effects. They typically occur in situations that involve relative comparison, where your performance relative to those around you is the determining factor in your success.</p>
<p>Not everything in life is a Winner-Take-All competition, but nearly every area of life is at least partially affected by limited resources. Any decision that involves using a limited resource like time or money will naturally result in a winner-take-all situation.</p>
<p>In situations like these, being just a little bit better than the competition can lead to outsized rewards because the winner takes all. You only win by 1 percent or 1 second or 1 dollar, but you capture 100 percent of the victory. The advantage of being a little bit better is not a little bit more reward, but the entire reward. The winner gets one and the rest get zero.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-25205 size-full" src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/winner-take-all-effects-e1505330841319.jpg" alt="Winner Take All Effects" srcset="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/winner-take-all-effects-e1505330841319.jpg 700w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/winner-take-all-effects-e1505330841319-140x100.jpg 140w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>Winner-Take-All Leads to Winner-Take-Most</h2>
<p>Winner-Take-All Effects in individual competitions can lead to Winner-Take-Most Effects in the larger game of life.</p>
<p>From this advantageous position—with the gold medal in hand or with cash in the bank or from the chair of the Oval Office—the winner begins the process of accumulating advantages that make it easier for them to win the next time around. What began as a small margin is starting to trend toward the 80/20 Rule.</p>
<p>If one road is slightly more convenient than the other, then more people travel down it and more businesses are likely to build alongside it. As more businesses are built, people have additional reasons for using the road and so it gets even more traffic. Soon you end up with a saying like, &#8220;20 percent of the roads receive 80 percent of the traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p>If one business has a technology that is more innovative than another, then more people will buy their products. As the business makes more money, they can invest in additional technology, pay higher salaries, and hire better people. By the time the competition catches up, there are other reasons for customers to stick with the first business. Soon, one company dominates the industry.</p>
<p>If one author hits the best-seller list, then publishers will be more interested in their next book. When the second book comes out, the publisher will put more resources and marketing power behind it, which makes it easier to hit the best-seller list for a second time. Soon, you begin to understand why a few books sell millions of copies while the majority struggle to sell a few thousand copies.</p>
<blockquote><p>The margin between good and great is narrower than it seems. What begins as a slight edge over the competition compounds with each additional contest.</p></blockquote>
<p>The margin between good and great is narrower than it seems. What begins as a slight edge over the competition compounds with each additional contest. Winning one competition improves your odds of winning the next. Each additional cycle further cements the status of those at the top.</p>
<p>Over time, those that are slightly better end up with the majority of the rewards. Those that are slightly worse end up with next to nothing. This idea is sometimes referred to as The Matthew Effect, which references a passage in The Bible that says, &#8220;For all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s come back to the question I posed near the beginning of this article. Why do a few people, teams, and organizations enjoy the bulk of the rewards in life?</p>
<h2>The 1 Percent Rule</h2>
<p>Small differences in performance can lead to very unequal distributions when repeated over time. This is yet another reason <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">why habits are so important</a>. The people and organizations that can do the right things, more consistently are more likely to maintain a slight edge and accumulate disproportionate rewards over time.</p>
<p>You only need to be slightly better than your competition, but if you are able to maintain a slight edge today and tomorrow and the day after that, then you can repeat the process of winning by just a little bit over and over again. And thanks to Winner-Take-All Effects, each win delivers outsized rewards.</p>
<p><strong>We can call this The 1 Percent Rule.</strong> The 1 Percent Rule states that over time the majority of the rewards in a given field will accumulate to the people, teams, and organizations that maintain a 1 percent advantage over the alternatives. You don&#8217;t need to be twice as good to get twice the results. You just need to be <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">slightly better</a>. <a href="#footnote-8-24687" id="note-8-24687" rel="footnote">8</a></p>
<p>The 1 Percent Rule is not merely a reference to the fact that small differences accumulate into significant advantages, but also to the idea that those who are 1 percent better <em>rule</em> their respective fields and industries. Thus, the process of accumulative advantage is the hidden engine that drives the 80/20 Rule.</p>

In any case, The 1 Percent Rule still holds: those who maintain small advantages, whether due to luck or hard work, gradually accumulate the bulk of the rewards.</p></li><!--/#footnote-8.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes-->]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The natural tendency of life is to find stability. In biology we refer to this process as equilibrium or homeostasis.</p>
<p>For example, consider your blood pressure. When it dips too low, your heart rate speeds up and nudges your blood pressure back into a healthy range. When it rises too high, your kidneys reduce the amount of fluid in the body by flushing out urine. All the while, your blood vessels help maintain the balance by contracting or expanding as needed.</p>
<p>The human body employs hundreds of feedback loops to keep your blood pressure, body temperature, glucose levels, calcium levels, and many other processes at a stable equilibrium.</p>
<p>In his book, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/mastery">Mastery</a>, martial arts master George Leonard points out that our daily lives also develop their own levels of homeostasis. We fall into patterns for how often we do (or don&#8217;t) exercise, how often we do (or don&#8217;t) clean the dishes, how often we do (or don&#8217;t) call our parents, and everything else in between. Over time, each of us settles into our own version of equilibrium.</p>
<p>Like your body, there are many forces and <a href="https://jamesclear.com/feedback-loops">feedback loops</a> that moderate the particular equilibrium of your habits. Your daily routines are governed by the delicate balance between <a href="https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment">your environment</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-myth">your genetic potential</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/measuring">your tracking methods</a>, and many other forces. As time goes on, this equilibrium becomes so normal that it becomes invisible. All of these forces are interacting each day, but we rarely notice how they shape our behaviors.</p>
<p>That is, until we try to make a change.</p>
<p><span id="more-23183"></span></p>
<h2>The Myth of Radical Change</h2>
<p>The myth of radical change and overnight success is pervasive in our culture. Experts say things like, &#8220;The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough.&#8221; Or they tell us, &#8220;If you want massive results, then you have to take massive action.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the surface, these phrases sound inspiring. What we fail to realize, however, is that any quest for rapid growth contradicts every stabilizing force in our lives. Remember, the natural tendency of life is to find stability. Anytime equilibrium is lost, the system is motivated to restore it.</p>
<p>If you step too far outside the bounds of your normal performance, then nearly all of the forces in your life will be screaming to get you back to equilibrium. If you take massive action, then you quickly run into a massive roadblock.</p>
<p>Nearly anyone who has tried to make a big change in their life has experienced some form of this. You finally work up the motivation to stick with a new diet only to find your co-workers subtly undermining your efforts. You commit to going for a run each night and within a week you&#8217;re asked to stay late at work. You start a new meditation habit and your kids keep barging into the room. <a href="#footnote-1-23183" id="note-1-23183" rel="footnote">1</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Resistance is proportionate to the size and speed of the change, not to whether the change is a favorable or unfavorable one.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The forces in our lives that have established our current equilibrium will work to pull us back whether we are trying to change for better or worse. In the words of George Leonard, &#8220;Resistance is proportionate to the size and speed of the change, not to whether the change is a favorable or unfavorable one.&#8221; <a href="#footnote-2-23183" id="note-2-23183" rel="footnote">2</a></p>
<p>In other words, the faster you try to change, the more likely you are to backslide. The very pursuit of rapid change dials up a wide range of counteracting forces which are fighting to pull you back into your previous lifestyle. You might be able to beat equilibrium for a little while, but pretty soon your energy fades and the backsliding begins.</p>
<h2>The Optimal Rate of Growth</h2>
<p>Of course, change is certainly possible, but it is only <em>sustainable</em> within <a href="https://jamesclear.com/upper-bound">a fairly narrow window</a>. When an athlete trains too hard, she ends up sick or injured. When a company changes course too quickly, the culture breaks down and employees get burnt out. When a leader pushes his personal agenda to the extreme, the nation riots and the people re-establish the balance of power. Living systems do not like extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a better way.</p>
<p>Consider the following quote from systems expert Peter Senge. &#8220;Virtually all natural systems, from ecosystems to animals to organizations, have intrinsically optimal rates of growth. The optimal rate is far less than the fastest possible growth. When growth becomes excessive—as it does in cancer—the system itself will seek to compensate by slowing down; perhaps putting the organization&#8217;s survival at risk in the process.&#8221; <a href="#footnote-3-23183" id="note-3-23183" rel="footnote">3</a></p>
<p>By contrast, when you accumulate small wins and focus on <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">one percent improvements</a>, you nudge equilibrium forward. It is like building muscle. If the weight is too light, your muscles will atrophy. If the weight is too heavy, you&#8217;ll end up injured. But if the weight is <a href="https://jamesclear.com/goldilocks-rule">just a touch beyond your normal</a>, then your muscles will adapt to the new stimulus and equilibrium will take a small step forward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-5986 size-full aligncenter" src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sustain1.jpg" alt="sustain your habits" width="700" height="460" srcset="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sustain1.jpg 700w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sustain1-140x92.jpg 140w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>The Paradox of Behavior Change</h2>
<p>In order for change to last, we must work with the fundamental forces in our lives, not against them. Nearly everything that makes up your daily life has an equilibrium—a natural set point, a normal pace, a typical rhythm. If we reach too far beyond this equilibrium, we will find ourselves being yanked back to the baseline.</p>
<p>Thus, the best way to achieve a new level of equilibrium is not with radical change, but through small wins each day.</p>
<p>This is the great paradox of behavior change. If you try to change your life all at once, you will quickly find yourself pulled back into the same patterns as before. But if you merely focus on changing your normal day, you will find your life changes naturally as a side effect.</p>
<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnotetitle">Footnotes</div><ol><li id="footnote-1-23183" class="footnote"><p>It is worth noting that radical change can work, but only under very specific circumstances. Most notably, radical changes work when we are forced to accept them permanently. For example, people will often radically change their behavior after major life events like graduating college, moving to a new city, starting a new job, getting married, having a baby. (Pro tip: don&#8217;t try all of those at once.) These big changes lead to entirely new habits that persist for years. Why? Because generally speaking, it&#8217;s quite difficult to get rid of a baby, get divorced, find a new job, move to a new city, and so on. The new lifestyle is permanent and so are the radically new habits that come with it.</p></li><!--/#footnote-1.footnote--><li id="footnote-2-23183" class="footnote"><p>In his book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/mastery">Mastery</a>, George Leonard shares an interesting insight about change and homeostasis. Leonard points out that stability is comfortable and that means, by default, change is uncomfortable. Thus, it is not always a bad thing to feel some pain or discomfort or uncertainty when trying something new (within reason) because these feelings can be seen as a signal not that something is wrong, but that something is right. You are experiencing discomfort precisely because you are changing.</p></li><!--/#footnote-2.footnote--><li id="footnote-3-23183" class="footnote"><p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/the-fifth-discipline">The Fifth Discipline</a> by Peter Senge.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is an excerpt from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, my New York Times bestselling book.</em></p>
<p>It can be tempting to blame failure on a lack of <a href="https://jamesclear.com/willpower">willpower</a> or a scarcity of talent, and to attribute success to hard work, effort, and <a href="https://jamesclear.com/grit">grit</a>.</p>
<p>To be sure, those things matter. What is interesting, however, is that if you examine how human behavior has been shaped over time, you discover that motivation (and even talent) is often overvalued. In many cases, the environment matters more.</p>
<p>Let me share an example that surprised me when I first learned of it.<span id="more-18517"></span></p>
<h2>The Shape of Human Behavior</h2>
<p>In his award-winning book, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/guns-germs-and-steel">Guns, Germs, and Steel</a>, anthropologist and biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: different continents have different shapes. At first glance, this statement seems rather obvious and unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound impact on human behavior.</p>
<p>The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is, the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape played a significant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-18522 size-full" src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/continent-orientation.jpg" alt="Continent Shape and Orientation. (Power of Environment)" width="1400" height="1200" srcset="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/continent-orientation.jpg 1400w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/continent-orientation-1200x1029.jpg 1200w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/continent-orientation-768x658.jpg 768w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/continent-orientation-960x823.jpg 960w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/continent-orientation-700x600.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<h2>The Remarkable Power of Environment</h2>
<p>When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an easier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south ones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally share similar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China.</p>
<p>By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to south. Just imagine how different the weather is in Florida compared to Canada. You can be the most talented farmer in the world, but it won’t help you grow Florida oranges in the Canadian winter. Snow is a poor substitute for soil. In order to spread crops along north-south routes, farmers would need to find and domesticate new plants whenever the climate changed.</p>
<p>As a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia and Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of centuries, this small difference had a very big impact. Increased food production allowed for more rapid population growth. With more people, these cultures were able to build stronger armies and were better equipped to develop new technologies. The changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly farther, a population that grew slightly faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time.</p>
<h2>The Invisible Hand</h2>
<p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. We tend to believe our <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">habits</a> are a product of our motivation, talent, and effort. Certainly, these qualities matter. But the surprising thing is, especially over a long time period, your personal characteristics tend to get overpowered by your environment.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the farmers of Europe and Asia were more talented or more motivated than farmers in the rest of the world. Yet, they were able to spread agriculture 2x to 3x faster than their peers. If you want to maximize your odds of success, then you need to operate in an environment that accelerates your results rather than hinders them.</p>
<h2>How to Design a Better Environment</h2>
<p>There are many ways to <a href="https://jamesclear.com/choice-architecture">design an environment</a> that promotes success.</p>
<p>Here are three strategies:</p>
<p><strong>First, automate good decisions.</strong> Whenever possible, design an environment that makes good decisions for you. For example, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/eat-healthy-without-thinking">buying smaller plates</a> can help you lose weight by deciding portion size for you. A study from Brian Wansink at Cornell University found that people eat 22 percent less food by switching from 12-inch dinner plates to 10-inch plates. Similarly, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/constraints">using software to block social media sites</a> can help overcome procrastination by putting your willpower on autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>Second, get in the flow.</strong> A few years ago, PetSmart changed their checkout process. After swiping their credit card, customers were shown a screen that asked if they wanted to donate to &#8220;help save homeless animals.&#8221; Through this single strategy, PetSmart Charities raised $40 million in a year. <a href="#footnote-1-18517" id="note-1-18517" rel="footnote">1</a></p>
<p>You can apply a similar strategy by designing an environment where good habits &#8220;get in the flow&#8221; of your normal behaviors. For example, if you want to practice a musical instrument, you could place it in the middle of your living room. Similarly, you are more likely to go to the gym if it is literally on the way home from work than if the gym is only five minutes away, but in the opposite direction of your commute. Whenever possible, design your habits so they fit in the flow of your current patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Third, subtract the negative influences.</strong> Ancient farmers didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to remove the barriers that held them back, but you do. For example, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/subtraction">Japanese television manufacturers rearranged their workspaces</a> to save time by eliminating unnecessary turning, bending, and swiveling. You can also reduce the negative influences in your environment. For example, you can make it easier to avoid unhealthy foods by storing them in less visible places. (Foods that are placed at eye level <a href="https://jamesclear.com/candy-checkout">tend to be purchased and eaten more frequently</a>.)</p>
<p>For more on how our environment shapes our habits (and actionable strategies to design environments that make your goals easier), check out my book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/atomic-habits"><em>Atomic</em> <em>Habits.</em></a></p>
<h2>The Luck of the Environment</h2>
<p>We are quick to blame our environment when things go poorly. If you lose a job, it&#8217;s because the economy sucks. If you lose a game, it&#8217;s because the officiating was bad. If you&#8217;re late to work, it&#8217;s because traffic was insane.</p>
<p>When we win, however, we ignore the environment completely. If you land a job, it&#8217;s because you were talented and likable. If you win a game, it&#8217;s because you played better. If you&#8217;re early for a meeting, it&#8217;s because you are organized and prompt.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the environment drives our good behaviors as well as our bad ones. People who seem to stick to good habits with ease are often benefitting from an environment that makes those behaviors easier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people who struggle to succeed could be fighting an uphill battle against their environment. What often looks like a lack of willpower is actually the result of a poor environment.</p>
<p>Life is a game and if you want to guarantee better results over a sustained period of time, the best approach is to play the game in an environment that favors you. Winners often win because their environment makes winning easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is an excerpt from <a title="Atomic Habits" href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>. </em></p>
<p class="03COBodyText">In the summer of 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months earlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.</p>
<p><span id="more-15204"></span>Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830.<a href="#footnote-1-15204" id="note-1-15204" rel="footnote">1</a> The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.</p>

<h2>The Ancient Problem of Akrasia</h2>
<p>Human beings have been procrastinating for centuries. Even prolific artists like Victor Hugo are not immune to the distractions of daily life. The problem is so timeless, in fact, that ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle developed a word to describe this type of behavior: <em>Akrasia</em>.</p>
<p><em>Akrasia</em> is the state of acting against your better judgment. It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else. Loosely translated, you could say that <em>akrasia</em> is procrastination or a lack of self-control. <em>Akrasia</em> is what prevents you from following through on what you set out to do.</p>
<p>Why would Victor Hugo commit to writing a book and then put it off for over a year? Why do we make plans, set deadlines, and commit to goals, but then fail to follow through on them?</p>
<h2>Why We Make Plans, But Don&#8217;t Take Action</h2>
<p>One explanation for why <em>akrasia</em> rules our lives and procrastination pulls us in has to do with a behavioral economics term called &#8220;time inconsistency.&#8221; Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards.</p>
<p>When you make plans for yourself — like setting a goal to lose weight or write a book or learn a language — you are actually making plans for your future self. You are envisioning what you want your life to be like in the future and when you think about the future it is easy for your brain to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits.</p>
<p>When the time comes to make a decision, however, you are no longer making a choice for your future self. Now you are in the moment and your brain is thinking about the present self. And researchers have discovered that the present self really likes instant gratification, not long-term payoff. This is one reason why you might go to bed feeling motivated to make a change in your life, but when you wake up you find yourself falling into old patterns. Your brain values long-term benefits when they are in the future, but it values immediate gratification when it comes to the present moment.</p>
<p>This is one reason why <a href="https://jamesclear.com/delayed-gratification">the ability to delay gratification</a> is such a great predictor of success in life. Understanding how to resist the pull of instant gratification—at least occasionally, if not consistently—can help you bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be.</p>
<h2>The Framework You Need to Beat Procrastination</h2>
<p>Here are three ways to overcome akrasia, beat procrastination, and follow through on what you set out to do.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1: Design your future actions.</strong></p>
<p>When Victor Hugo locked his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating what psychologists refer to as a &#8220;commitment device.&#8221; A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.<a href="#footnote-2-15204" id="note-2-15204" rel="footnote">2</a> It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.</p>
<p class="04BodyText">There are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk size. You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and online poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of athletes who have to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave their wallets at home during the week before weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.</p>
<p>The circumstances differ, but the message is the same: commitment devices can help you design your future actions. Find ways to automate your behavior beforehand rather than relying on willpower in the moment. Be the architect of your future actions, not the victim of them. <a href="#footnote-3-15204" id="note-3-15204" rel="footnote">3</a></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2: Reduce the friction of starting.</strong></p>
<p>The guilt and frustration of procrastinating is usually worse than the pain of doing the work. In the words of Eliezer Yudkowsky, &#8220;On a moment-to-moment basis, being in the middle of doing the work is usually less painful than being in the middle of procrastinating.&#8221;</p>
<p>So why do we still procrastinate? Because it&#8217;s not being <em>in</em> the work that is hard, it&#8217;s <em>starting</em> the work. The friction that prevents us from taking action is usually centered around starting the behavior. Once you begin, it&#8217;s often less painful to do the work. This is why it is often more important to <a href="https://jamesclear.com/start-succeed">build the habit of getting started</a> when you&#8217;re beginning a new behavior than it is to worry about whether or not you are successful at the new habit.</p>
<p>You have to constantly <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habit-guide">reduce the size of your habits</a>. Put all of your effort and energy into <a href="https://jamesclear.com/twyla-tharp">building a ritual</a> and make it as easy as possible to get started. Don&#8217;t worry about the results until you&#8217;ve mastered the art of showing up.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3: Utilize implementation intentions.</strong></p>
<p>An implementation intention is when you state your intention to implement a particular behavior at a specific time in the future. For example, &#8220;I will exercise for at least 30 minutes on [DATE] in [PLACE] at [TIME].&#8221;</p>
<p>There are hundreds of successful studies showing how implementation intentions positively impact everything from exercise habits to flu shots. In the flu shot study, researchers looked at a group of 3,272 employees at a Midwestern company and found that employees who wrote down the specific date and time they planned to get their flu shot were significantly more likely to follow through weeks later. <a href="#footnote-4-15204" id="note-4-15204" rel="footnote">4</a></p>
<p>It seems simple to say that scheduling things ahead of time can make a difference, but as I have covered previously, implementation intentions can make you <a href="https://jamesclear.com/implementation-intentions">2x to 3x more likely</a> to perform an action in the future.</p>
<h2>Fighting Akrasia</h2>
<p>Our brains prefer instant rewards to long-term payoffs. It&#8217;s simply a consequence of how our minds work. Given this tendency, we often have to resort to crazy strategies to get things done—like Victor Hugo locking up all of his clothes so he could write a book. But I believe it is worth it to spend time building these commitment devices if your goals are important to you.</p>
<p>Aristotle coined the term <em>enkrateia</em> as the antonym of <em>akrasia</em>. While <em>akrasia</em> refers to our tendency to fall victim to procrastination, <em>enkrateia</em> means to be &#8220;in power over oneself.&#8221; Designing your future actions, reducing the friction of starting good behaviors, and using implementation intentions are simple steps that you can take to make it easier to live a life of <em>enkrateia</em> rather than one of <em>akrasia</em>. <a href="#footnote-5-15204" id="note-5-15204" rel="footnote">5</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is an excerpt from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, my New York Times bestselling book.</em></p>
<p>The fate of British Cycling changed one day in 2003.</p>
<p>The organization, which was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games,<a href="#footnote-1-5432" id="note-1-5432" rel="footnote">1</a> and they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event. <a href="#footnote-2-5432" id="note-2-5432" rel="footnote">2</a></p>
<p>In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.<a href="#footnote-3-5432" id="note-3-5432" rel="footnote">3</a></p>
<p>Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”<a href="#footnote-4-5432" id="note-4-5432" rel="footnote">4</a></p>
<p>Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic. <a href="#footnote-5-5432" id="note-5-5432" rel="footnote">5</a></p>
<p>But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find <a href="https://jamesclear.com/the-1-percent-rule">1 percent improvements</a> in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes. <a href="#footnote-6-5432" id="note-6-5432" rel="footnote">6</a></p>
<p>As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the results came faster than anyone could have imagined.</p>
<p>Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. <a href="#footnote-7-5432" id="note-7-5432" rel="footnote">7</a> Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world records.<a href="#footnote-8-5432" id="note-8-5432" rel="footnote">8</a></p>
<p>That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. <a href="#footnote-9-5432" id="note-9-5432" rel="footnote">9</a>The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years.<a href="#footnote-10-5432" id="note-10-5432" rel="footnote">10</a></p>
<p>During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured 5 Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.<a href="#footnote-11-5432" id="note-11-5432" rel="footnote">11</a></p>
<p>How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life?</p>
<p><span id="more-5432"></span></p>
<h2>The Aggregation of Marginal Gains</h2>
<p>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even <em>noticeable</em>—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. <a href="#footnote-12-5432" id="note-12-5432" rel="footnote">12</a> Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5852" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-5852 size-full" src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tiny-gains-graph.jpg" alt="The aggregation of marginal gains shows how small improvements and one percent gains compound. " width="700" height="400" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5852" class="wp-caption-text">Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the beginning, there is basically no difference between making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse. (In other words, it won&#8217;t impact you very much today.) But as time goes on, these small improvements or declines compound and you suddenly find <a href="https://jamesclear.com/the-1-percent-rule">a very big gap</a> between people who make slightly better decisions on a daily basis and those who don&#8217;t. This is why small choices don&#8217;t make much of a difference at the time, but add up over the long-term.</p>
<p>On a related note, this is why I love <a title="schedule goals" href="https://jamesclear.com/schedule-goals">setting a schedule for important things</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/plan-failure">planning for failure</a>, and using the <a title="good habits" href="https://jamesclear.com/good-habits">&#8220;never miss twice&#8221; rule</a>. I know that it&#8217;s not a big deal if I make a mistake or slip up on a habit every now and then. It&#8217;s the compound effect of never getting back on track that causes problems. By setting a schedule to never miss twice, you can prevent simple errors from snowballing out of control.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line About Small Improvements</h2>
<blockquote><p>Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.<br />
—Jim Rohn</p></blockquote>
<p>You probably won’t find yourself in the Tour de France anytime soon, but the concept of aggregating marginal gains can be useful all the same.</p>
<p>Most people love to talk about success (and life in general) as an event. We talk about losing 50 pounds or building a successful business or winning the Tour de France as if they are events. But the truth is that most of the significant things in life aren&#8217;t stand-alone events, but rather the sum of all the moments when we chose to do things 1 percent better or 1 percent worse. Aggregating these marginal gains makes a difference.</p>
<p>There is power in small improvements and slow gains. This is why <a title="average speed" href="https://jamesclear.com/average-speed">average speed yields above average results</a>. This is why <a title="goals and systems" href="https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems">the system is greater than the goal</a>. This is why <a title="transform your habits" href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">mastering your habits</a> is more important than achieving a certain outcome.</p>
<p>Where are the 1 percent improvements in your life?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is an excerpt from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, my New York Times bestselling book.</em></p>
<p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific, actionable goals.</p>
<p>For many years, this was how I approached my habits too. Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</p>
<p><span id="more-5344"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.</li>
<li>If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.</li>
</ul>

" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/systems-vs-goals-700x467.jpg 700w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/systems-vs-goals-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/systems-vs-goals-768x512.jpg 768w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/systems-vs-goals-140x93.jpg 140w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/systems-vs-goals-960x640.jpg 960w, https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/systems-vs-goals.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Now for the interesting question: if you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results?</p>
<p>I think you would.</p>
<p>The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.</p>
<h2>Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.</h2>
<p>Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.</p>
<p>Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British Cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.</p>
<h2>Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.</h2>
<p>Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.</p>
<p>Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p>
<h2>Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.</h2>
<p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax.</p>
<p>Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.</p>
<p>A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</p>
<h2>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.</h2>
<p>Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.</p>
<p>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.</p>
<h2>Fall In Love With Systems</h2>
<p>None of this is to say that goals are useless. However, I&#8217;ve found that goals are good for <em>planning</em> your progress and systems are good for actually <em>making</em> progress.</p>
<p>Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference.<a href="#footnote-1-5344" id="note-1-5344" rel="footnote">1</a></p>
