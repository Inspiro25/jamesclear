As a professional artist, a musician with 2 CD&#039;s on the market, and a professional coach, the process of creating (the fight) is what it&#039;s all about. More folks in our achievement-oriented culture need to understand that that&#039;s where the satisfaction originates.]]></description>

Viraj, I totally agree with &#039;Success doesn’t feel that good if there was no struggle involved to achieve it&#039;. 
Sometimes I think that the success becomes a let&#039;s say &#039;by-product&#039; of this struggling process or sometimes even natural consequence. But the most important thing for me is still the struggling even though it&#039;s difficult sometimes but totally worth it!
James you made my day...again :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful read to start my day! I love all analogies to baseball - a sport that I enjoyed so much as a kid. That pitching experience was an excellent example of truly being in the moment - focusing all of your energy, your heart and soul, your mind and body on accomplishing one thing. In that moment, it&#039;s not the glory that might come from striking the guy out or the possibility of fame and fortune, it&#039;s not even actually striking the guy out - it&#039;s all about throwing that ball to the best of your ability, bringing everything that you have learned to that point together in a single effort to &quot;let it fly&quot; and land where it may. Those moments are some of the best that life has to offer!!  Thanks for the reminder!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James

Great Read!

There is something magical about being in the zone. In that zone we experience all sorts of things, the ups and downs, joys and pains of being in that struggle. But, no matter the outcome, when we play &#039;till the end of the game we can be proud that we stuck
with it. 

Remember, in the 1988 World Series, Kirk Gibson came to the plate all beat up? He was facing Dennis E. of Oakland,  one of the best relief pitchers, what did Kirk Gibson do? He hammered that ball over the fence!

James thank you for your posts!
