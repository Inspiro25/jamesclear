					<description><![CDATA[Great article. I am currently providing opportunities for people to expose themselves to these benefits through sculpting parties and the testimonials support your article. I also have experience teaching art to children with disabilities and have seen these benefits first hand. Keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love your clear, concise writing. I am about to start a small creative studio with the simple goal of getting everyday people to realize they have an artist within, and encourage them to be creative. In order to start this, I will need to do a small crowdfunding...may I use some of your quotes to promote this idea of the value of art?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I work for a bank, a pretty progressive bank though, in that they have a daily motivational activity that another employee leads on a rotating basis. So for my motivational activity I am encouraging them to use the right side of their brain and be creative by drawing to help counter balance all of the left brain activity we do for our work. This article greatly benefits my research for my &quot;assignment&quot; so thank you! I&#039;m going to get these bankers to draw!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I concur with these:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Improved well–being by decreasing negative emotions and increasing positive ones”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Improved medical outcomes, trends toward reduced depression”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Reductions in stress and anxiety; increases in positive emotions”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Reductions in distress and negative emotions”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Improvements in flow and spontaneity, expression of grief, positive identity, and social networks”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I instinctively knew them to be true, but it&#039;s always validating to see other references that prove the facts.

This was beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this, and now I&#039;m off to create some more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this, James. As an indie author, I&#039;m always looking for new ways to express creativity and share it. The internet has been amazing for all of us as both artists and students. I feel so optimistic about the &quot;collective&quot; creativity and where it&#039;s heading. What a great time to be alive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/make-more-art#comment-1427&quot;&gt;Joel Zaslofsky&lt;/a&gt;.

Joel -- great to hear from you! I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve found the power of creating rather than consuming! (Sounds like you&#039;ve built an awesome challenge too!)

I love that Neil Gaiman speech. It&#039;s a winner.

Keep up the good work! It&#039;s great to have you in our little community!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/make-more-art#comment-1425&quot;&gt;Deidre J. Edwards&lt;/a&gt;.

I love to hear that, Deidre! Ultimately, knowledge is useless without action, so my goal is always to break things down into practical ideas that we can actually use.

Keep up the great work and thanks for reading!]]></description>
