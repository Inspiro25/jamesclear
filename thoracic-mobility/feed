					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a young athlete who has been doing fairly intense physical labor for a few years, and I&#039;ve always been a bit worried about the health of my spine due to that. I&#039;ve been having a very odd back pain that is almost always unnoticeable except for very occasional movements. Strangely enough, the twisting motion of this excercise brings the pain about. Anyone have any ideas on what this means?]]></description>

You sure about it trashing your knees? My knees aren&#039;t great but it doesn&#039;t affect them at all. It&#039;s much more intense on your torso/lower back and shoulders.]]></description>

I was wondering the exact same thing. Do you hold the position for 30 seconds on each side, like a plank?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some great points in this article and we really need to think about posture and flexibility when working at the computer all day but I&#039;d have trouble with this too because I don&#039;t sit working in shorts (or PJs) ready to leap into action when I have a break. Not that it&#039;s so bad getting changed but any barrier and it&#039;s less likely to happen.]]></description>
