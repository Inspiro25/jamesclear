					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/get-back-on-track#comment-13209&quot;&gt;Boris&lt;/a&gt;.

I agree. The simple start is hugely powerful. Just do *something.* For me, in working towards becoming a proficient drummer by establishing a daily habit of practicing morning and evening, when it&#039;s hard to get out of the chair and in front of the kit or the practice pad, I&#039;ll get up to rinse the dishes and then before I can think about it I&#039;ll put a spare practice pad on the counter, grab a pair of drumsticks (my drum kit is in the kitchen, so it&#039;s really convenient ;-) ) and start practicing a rudiment. That often becomes fun and leads into more practice, but even if it doesn&#039;t, at least I know I did *something*.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you James. I recently started a ketogenic version of my paleo diet - so much so that the girl I have the hots for came up and leaned into me because I was so grounded and solid! I didn&#039;t need any blogs, scripts, etc. - I was just being me and that was IT and the connection was awesome from that place of being myself with great boundaries and solidity.

Of course after that I took a few steps back and wasn&#039;t prepared for this assuming I&#039;d just be &quot;the man&quot; consistently without keeping habits and staying onnit and thought I&#039;d be fine going back to coffee and some things I know don&#039;t work so well for me.

So this is good to hear and also something to take to heart because sometimes I delude myself and forget the fundamentals and can get into beating myself up.

Thanks again and look forward to the next!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had back pain called sciatica for 16 yrs. Suffered quite a bit when it strikes with bed rest, which means off work for 2 - 4 weeks. 2 years ago a physiotherapist taught me a simple exercise. I just stick to that less than 5 mts exercise and I have been fine. Not that I didn&#039;t develop back pain but the reassurance from the simple exercise helps me to function normally.

Sticking to a habit however simple and small takes you a long way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another excellent article, looks like I am creating a habit of saying thank you to James. :)

To get back on track, I found that simple start is most powerful. If you miss the gym or fall on diet, or in any way can&#039;t resist temptation, the best you can do is to simply start doing better and not lose time on lamentation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/get-back-on-track#comment-605&quot;&gt;MOOSE&lt;/a&gt;.

Nice -- I like the idea of a built-in buffer zone where you plan for failure and mistakes, and don&#039;t beat yourself up about it. In the end, the goal is to live your life better, not to be a robot. 

Keep up the good work, Moose. I&#039;m excited to hear about how you put these ideas into practice.]]></description>

Routine is everything. Very rarely do we have a single event that transforms our life. Most of the time even the big events fade away after a week or a month. It&#039;s the daily habits that make the difference in the long run.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/get-back-on-track#comment-608&quot;&gt;Tammy R&lt;/a&gt;.

Tammy, that&#039;s a great example of the power of building the habit first and worrying about &quot;doing it right&quot; later. In my opinion, this is one of the most critical changes that could lead to success for most people. Who cares if you&#039;re not meditating the &quot;best&quot; way in the beginning? Once you make a habit of it and meditate on a consistent basis (as you did), then you can figure out how to do it better.

And yet, so often, we spend all of our time researching more and doing less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/get-back-on-track#comment-610&quot;&gt;Jennie&lt;/a&gt;.

Jennie -- thanks for sharing. It&#039;s great to hear how these strategies are being used and what is actually working in the real world. Keep up the great work!

p.s. Your approach makes perfect sense. Once we get started with something (or with nothing, in the case of sitting around), it&#039;s always easier to keep doing that rather than doing something different.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent job bringing it all together here, James.  Designing my environment for success is definitely one of the best ways for me to get back on track.  

I&#039;ve started realizing that the key for all of these strategies is to really pay attention to what if going on inside our head, what our barriers are, and what the trigger is for either reaching that state of flow or spending the weekend on the couch. I recognized that what I do when I get home from work sets the tone for the rest of the night or weekend. If I do something active and productive right away like doing dishes then I&#039;m more likely to get my workout in because my mind is in productive mode. If I sit down on the couch or at my computer right away then I&#039;ve entered my relaxation mode and its harder to pull myself out of that. Since realizing this I&#039;ve been using your strategy of connecting a new habit with a current behavior and when I&#039;ve scheduled a workout I walk in my front door, change my clothes, and do the dishes or tidy up. Then since I&#039;m already being productive I start my workout. Sounds a little crazy, but it works for me!]]></description>
