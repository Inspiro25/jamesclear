					<description><![CDATA[James, I can&#039;t say I have a favorite from the top 10 list.  All were well written and researched.  I only discovered you this past year but I look forward to more delightful insights in 2014.  

The one that stood out was the article on criticism.  I didn&#039;t realize the impact that negativity has on a person&#039;s work until I read your article and saw your statistics.  I have begun to develop a thick skin as I realize that critics are everywhere and that&#039;s just part of life.  You have to be better than them and not let what they say impact your dreams and passion.  I guess it just hit home that everyone has come across a jerk, someone that wants to knock you down when you are doing great work, you just have to believe in yourself.  There is a whole lot of us  who enjoy the fruits of your labor, myself included.  It&#039;s kind of a pick me up when I read your articles.

You truly inspire me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really connected with your first article, &quot;Successful People Start Before They Feel Ready.&quot;

I didn&#039;t realize it until now, but that&#039;s a major part of how I&#039;ve found success at any of the businesses I started. There&#039;s really something to this concept. Perhaps it&#039;s the challenge of getting involved in something I&#039;m uncomfortable with and the energy and drive I bring to those moments that help me find my path to success.

Thanks for the thought provoking articles, James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a simple thank you for your articles. What I like about them, in contrast to other articles that encourage a more positive lifestyle and attitude, is that your content provides practical instructions. You do not just encourage, you demonstrate -- very practically. Nothing wrong with uplifting articles without do-able practical instruction, but it is often the &quot;working out how to apply the advice&quot; part which causes one to ignore it. 

In fact, often after reading some article on, say, being more grateful or not dwelling on negativity -- after the initial &quot;Yes! I am going to be really positive FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!&quot; rush -- comes a sort of downer. First, because the article makes you become more aware of an area which you could improve but more importantly the instruction is either non-existent, minimal or a bit silly (sit in front of a candle every night and think of three people you could smile at tomorrow). 

In fact, I sometimes have felt that one feels most comfortable when one just gives up on self-improvement entirely! But that can easily descend into just not giving a **** about anything and eating McDonalds every day, but I am sure you know what I mean, we can OD on all this &quot;live life to the max&quot; stuff. Anyway, I like them because they are 90% &quot;normal fallible busy human&quot; proof. They embrace and accept failure more than other stuff I have read. They find a nice place for it within the overall striving for improvement. 

Anyway, I am procrastinating now, but thanks James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I have read a few of these posts, and they were awesome.  Thanks for giving me a nice collection (of the ones I haven&#039;t read) I can peruse for the few weeks of &quot;James Clear withdrawal&quot;

Have a great vacation. You have earned it bro!]]></description>
