					<description><![CDATA[I agree that exercise definitely helps with depression.  I already exercise regularly, but sometimes I don&#039;t feel like exercising.  When that happens if I usually force myself to exercise anyway I always feel better and am glad I did and if I decide not to exercise I feel worse.  So I&#039;m not sure if exercise is a cure, more like a lifelong treatment.

In either case it motivates me to keep up the work, because nobody likes feeling depressed and exercise makes me feel better physically and emotionally.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/exercise-and-depression#comment-10724&quot;&gt;KaDerrick&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi KaDerrick -- sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I do want to point out one thing about this study: exercise worked well for people with mild to moderate bouts of depression, not for severe depression. Obviously, I don&#039;t know the details of your specific situation and can&#039;t comment on that, but my suggestion would be to use this information in conjunction with your physician and not as a strict replacement to it. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had major depressive disorder and social anxiety for over 8 years, and I have tried exercising for the past 2 years every other day for at least 30 minutes. I have felt zero effect on my symptoms even combined with therapy. For me I can&#039;t say that exercise has any effect on depression. I wish that wasn&#039;t the case.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got an email the other week saying about the same thing. and there&#039;s no denying the truth in this. Especially in the rebuilding the identity part. brilliant. But I have the same thoughts then as I do now. This information is especially useful to people who are, well, not depressed, dare I say. It&#039;s absolutely motivating and helpful to keep going when you are just starting out for example but it&#039;s just not going to make a depressed person head over to the gym. It&#039;s just not. A major factor I think in these studies is that the people who where in the excercising groups where being guided yeah. They got help, didn&#039;t have to do it on their own. That&#039;s an entirely different situation. Think about how hard it can be for a non-depressed person even to get motivated to start moving let alone someone who&#039;s in that black mental state. With other issues as anxiety, social fears, low self-esteem etc... in the picture too.

I&#039;m not being negative or anything, au contraire. I think the question how depressed people REALLY can be helped into finding excercise a helpful strategy in their battle is sadly been neglected. Sure GP&#039;s and shrinks and friends and family tell their patients and loved ones to &#039;go exercise&#039; but well, that&#039;s not enough. Just my thoughts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

Prior to becoming an avid surfer I used to have a really bad case of IBS. I tried just about everything from diet changes to anti-depressants. What&#039;s interesting is I was also fairly depressed during most of that time. Everything really stressed me about. Something as a simple as a long line would send me into a frenzy. 

When I started surfing all that changed.  The stomach aches really calmed down. I felt emotionally and physically better than I ever have. SO it&#039;s not surprise to me that exercise has the impact on depression that it does.]]></description>

Thanks for sharing your experiences, Michelle. I&#039;m happy to help however I can (even if it is just with a little article). I&#039;ll do my best to keep great ideas coming your way.

As far as getting started and getting over the motivation hurdle, you might enjoy the following articles. At the very least, they&#039;ll give you some different things to think about when it comes to starting your habits.

1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/how-to-get-motivated&quot; title=&quot;how to get motivated&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to Get Motivated&lt;/a&gt;
2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/start-succeed&quot; title=&quot;get started&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why Getting Started is More Important Than Succeeding&lt;/a&gt;
3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/start-working-out&quot; title=&quot;how to start working out&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to Start Working Out&lt;/a&gt;

And as always, thanks for reading!]]></description>
