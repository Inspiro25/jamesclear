					<description><![CDATA[James,  Great article in distilling so much helpful thinking into one article.  I especially thank you for introducing me to  Brene Brown.  Wow, her work is so thought provoking and makes such sense but yet not realized.  Transformational is the only way to describe her work.  So much of what you said about the spiritual ties into her work and the sense of value -  the source of our ultimate value. Many thanks,   Steve]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff, yet again. I am a huge fan of Lissa Rankin and Brene Brown. I&#039;m working through the online Gifts of Imperfection course right now, and I am so thankful for everyone bringing this important information to surface. I&#039;m trying to get the message out there in my little community, wish me luck :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow!  This article pretty much explains why I am, the way I am.  I&#039;ve been consistently guilty of numbers 1, 4, 5, 6  and 10 pretty much my entire life.  To sum it up, I&#039;ve never participated in life (sports, happiness, friends); always watching from the safe sidelines.  But I think it all boils down to number 10.  If a child or youth isn&#039;t able to overcome their vulnerability and believe they are worthy of happiness and a sense of self worth, it can carry on to a very miserable adult life...and overcoming it at age 41 feels almost impossible.]]></description>
