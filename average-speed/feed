					<description><![CDATA[Dude, your blog and writing is so infectious, I love it!

Not sure how I found your blog, was a few weeks ago, but I&#039;m so glad I did. I recently read a comment that another member left on a different post and it said something about how excited they were to receive your weekly emails. This is so true, they seem to bring an extra air of positivity on that day.

Your posts are so refreshing and make perfect sense - habits, process, action -  life changing factors that I will now certainly integrate into my daily routine.

Thank you!

Good luck with your writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so true. I even find that I get to my destination faster when I put my car on cruise control, rather than control the speed myself, because the average speed will be higher on cruise. I would have never believed it until I tried it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started the 3+2 program 3 weeks ago. This is a running program designed up to the marathon level. I started it because I had been running for 3 years, without any improvement or satisfaction.

So I started with the beginners program and I&#039;m going to see what happens. I&#039;m consistent, not missing a session, in fact it looks a lot like your Milo&#039;s story. Talk to you in 9 weeks to see if I can run a 5th with thus attitude.
