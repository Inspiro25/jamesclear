					<description><![CDATA[Very inspiring reading...reminds me what I read in Anselm Grum books who draws from the experience the Desert Fathers and also benedictines monks: In every action or field people supposed to heed forehandedness and simplicity. :)

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great read. Thanks! 

I used to rearrange my bedroom when I was young. It definitely cleared my mind and, looking back I see it changed my habits. 

Now I&#039;m going to try it again and break old patterns!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am  focusing on changing my binary consciousness to uni consciousness by thinking of TIME as a hologram not a narrative and like a kaleidoscope changing the me and myself dialogue into a oneness of being! Apparently a Ken Wilber has developed seven levels of awareness of this effort (phenomena)? What is your take on this as explained in Eckhart Tolle&#039;s chapt 8 of BEING IN THE NOW?]]></description>

Hey Tony,

No need to apologise. I didn&#039;t know how your first answer was meant. So I decided to take it as a comliment. =)

I agree with your keys for major changes. I haven&#039;t figured out goals completely for myself yet, but without them there is no reason for change or to implement new habits. I just know this:

Goals are the beginning and the the end.

And thanks for throwing mindfulness in. Haven&#039;t thought about that a lot, but think it is important as well. It fits perfectly in an idea about the right mindset i just thought about recently.

Have a good weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rigging your environment works 100% of the time. When I&#039;m in a place that supports health and makes life simple, like during my recent 35-day trip on an island, I automatically lived differently and became a new person overnight regardless of the habits I had living here in the states being in a city. 

Never considered how this happened, but this equation hits it completely. The purpose of my trip was for personal &#038; spiritual growth (Person) and I was in nature with whole organic raw foods and with an older, wiser mentor (Environment). My Behavior was totally conducive and aligned with the learning that transpired there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello James,

I found this article just as insightful as all your others. However, I have a fundamental question. I buy in to the idea that the mind is its own place, and hence, it could turn a situation worse or better. In that case, isn&#039;t one&#039;s behavior really a function of only the personality?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Super helpful to think about in the way you frame it, James.  As a social worker, it is rather ironic, since Lewin&#039;s equation is essentially social work in practice (considering a person in their environment), which is different from other helping professional perspectives.

If a person&#039;s environment is not optimal for a person&#039;s functioning, then it doesn&#039;t support their well-being or functioning.  Programs for very vulnerable people, such as &quot;wrap around services&quot; look to change certain aspects of the environment to &quot;wrap around&quot; the needs of the vulnerable individual or family.  This equation takes it down to the most fundamental, most concrete aspects of environment and suggests how change happens and what it is that we actually have control over even when an environment is far from optimal.

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post, and I agree with everything. Would love to see an expansion of the other side of the equation: creating environments that amplify positive behaviours. Making unhealthy food inaccessible is great, and the flip side is to stock your home with appealing and easily made healthy treats. Personally, my trick is to really focus on being strong in the grocery store since that is the genesis of most foods that find their way into my home. Don&#039;t ever shop hungry and plan and commit to being ruthless for that one hour and the rest of the week is so much easier when you block that crap from entering your home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/lewins-equation#comment-11386&quot;&gt;Tony Barton&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Steffen

I wanted to apologise. Yesterday I was a little taken a back with your comments. 

I just read them again and am getting what you&#039;re saying. Your advice is so foreign that I didn&#039;t get it at first. 

In hindsight willpower has never been present in any of the major changes that I have made.  The keys for me have been goal setting, visualisation, planning, preparation, implementation and assessment.  

However, the biggest piece by far is &quot;mindfulness&quot;. Paying attention in the moment, moment by moment, as if your life depended on it.

Thanks for making the effort to comment. You changed how I think. Good on you.]]></description>
