					<description><![CDATA[Thanks James for the great article!

I&#039;ve read this one and your &#039;Introduction to Sleep Deprivation&#039; article and as much as they are very useful to the average person who works a regular 9-5 Monday to Friday workweek it&#039;s lacking when it comes to shift workers. Shift work is becoming more and more prevalent and its hard to find any kind of helpful advice pertaining to maintaining a healthy lifestyle while being a shift worker. That includes how to balance exercising, eating healthy and sleep in order to be healthy while, and in spite of, working various shifts like weekend, evenings and overnights. 

Is this something you would consider researching and writing an article about? Would be much appreciated!

Keep up the great work! ]]></description>

Maybe you have a dictating machine lying around? Sometimes I use WhatsApp on my mobile phone to record thoughts and send them to myself (but use flying-mode at night).

I remember what happened at night most of the time when i wake up in the morning, so i don&#039;t know if this can help you.]]></description>

Thanks Steffen. I&#039;d like to get more scientific about tracking my sleeping habits (am doing so in other areas of life), but find it difficult to get up, turn on the light, and take notes in the middle of the night. By the time I wake up, it&#039;s harder to remember the exact feelings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is been one of my &#039;key pin&#039; habits that if I get right influences everything.  For the last 5 years I&#039;ve been waking with only 5 hours of sleep (I have to go the bathroom at that time incidentally) with inability to get back to sleep, about half the time.  I&#039;ve even changed my wind-down-program or show, to be in that morning time, when it has fluctuated to less than half the time being able to sleep, so as to minimize worrying-in-bed about it and other things.  It has been the hugest time waster in my life, this problem.  Things are in a decent range now, but I do fluctuate in getting to bed on time.  So, I&quot;ll start here; is the message, so as to not keep on having this inability to have structure based off this one problem.  So, once again, thank you for keeping at this game.  The best thing I&#039;ve come across to help me with this problem?  Dale Carnegie&#039;s book on mp3 onto my phone that he took 6 years to write called, &quot;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&quot;.  The best pre-bed time body primer for getting to sleep almost every time:  http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/Body-Scan-for-Sleep.mp3  More subtle than you think, at least for me... try it!  The guy who shared it with me told me it has never failed him.  Pretty close to the mark if all the other stage is set.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I attended a talk on managing stress by a clinical psychologist two days ago. Towards the end of her talk, she played a Progressive Muscle Relaxation guided meditation mp3. I felt instantly relaxed just after 10 minutes. She suggested that we all try it at home as a way to wind down at night. I tried it for two nights in a row and I believe my sleep quality has improved since. So I recommend guided PMR meditation before bed time. There are so many to choose from on YouTube. You won&#039;t go very wrong if you pick one of those with the most views. Try it!]]></description>

Sometimes your mind tries to not forget something because it is important. Maybe journaling can help. Write everything down that&#039;s in your head every evening to stop your thoughts cycling around these problems.

I wake up at night if I keep my socks on.

Start making experiments: Try to leave the window open or closed. Try leaving your socks on or not leaving &#039;em on. Try to eat your last meal sooner. Try to not drink one hour before sleeptime. Try to drink a tea in the evening. Try what makes sense to you.]]></description>

Hi Chris,

Your comment reminded me for an article by the BBC Magazine entitled &quot;The myth of the eight-hour sleep.&quot;  Some interesting information related to your delemma.  I couldn&#039;t agree more with James&#039; article above though.

					<description><![CDATA[I like this way of thinking about sleep. I think the same way, letting my body choose intensity and duration, while controlling wakeup time instead of bedtime.

Why? For me, getting out of bed when sleepy is a choice, while sleeping when I am not sleepy is impossible. 

If I get up at seven for three days, I start falling asleep around midnight and wake up rested. If I force myself to stay up late, or choose to sleep late for more than a day, I start feeling sleepy during the day.

After three days, or a week if I have really messed with my rhythm, my body readjusts and I feel awake. Most of the time it&#039;s really that simple.]]></description>
