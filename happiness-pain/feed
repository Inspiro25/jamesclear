					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your wonderful words of wisdom. It&#039;s not that I haven&#039;t heard this before in a different way, it&#039;s that I needed to be reminded of the message after a difficult day building my new business. Your timing was spot on. Thank you for helping us improve our lives.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/happiness-pain#comment-4673&quot;&gt;Ryan J Riehl&lt;/a&gt;.

I thought about that, too, Ryan. I&#039;ve split the difference on it. This week, I started getting up 60-90 minutes earlier to balance the bank books, pay bills, plan what I&#039;m going to write today, and so forth. Since I already was getting up at 5:30, it&#039;s not easy. But I was so burned out on decision fatigue by the evening, nothing was getting done. Even after just a couple of days, I&#039;m doing more.

So I guess I&#039;m saying to do the creative work that you&#039;re excited to do after the tough responsibilities that you&#039;d put off to do the creative work. And by you, I mean me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/happiness-pain#comment-4693&quot;&gt;José&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Jose -- It sounds like we are following the same strategy. My suggestion is to stack the pain early in the process and end well, which is the same as giving &quot;negative feedback first and ending on a positive note.&quot; 

Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting to read your thoughts. This is actually the opposite of what I was taught when I was doing my PGCE (teacher training higher education). We were told to give the negative feedback first and to an end on a positive note. I spent 20 years as a university lecturer and I wonder  whether I caused unnecessary emotional/psychological distress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/happiness-pain#comment-4667&quot;&gt;marshall moose&lt;/a&gt;.

i don&#039;t exactly know what you mean with &quot;logistical stuff&quot;, but i think you could say or write something like this:

if you want to get X, it&#039;s important that you do these things first. actually doing these steps first will make the whole process easier for you. a lot of people do this wrong and start right of with X but won&#039;t finish it in the end. so with doing these things first, you are already ahead of the others and closer to finishing X.

great article James. this is probably a fundamental principle (i don&#039;t follow way too often).]]></description>
