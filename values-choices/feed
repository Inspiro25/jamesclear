					<description><![CDATA[James, what if you have too many or a LARGE list of values and the decision making process gets overwhelming weighing them against each and every value? What is your recommendation on this? Personally, when I do my annual planning, I think about three words that are going to drive how I act towards my clients and how will I act within my business. My words for 2014 are encourage, excite and engage. I base a lot of decisions on these three words. I guess these act as values for me. Would like to know your thoughts on this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I&#039;ve subscribed to your posts for about 2 months now. If I may be so forward, let me tell you that I am so inspired. Since I&#039;ve graduated University 4 years ago, I&#039;ve lost my motivation to progress in various aspects of my life, and I&#039;m only starting again to reclaim that part of me.

I&#039;m very interested in how you get are inspired by the ideas that you write. Would be able able to recommend any books that were particularly impactful for you? 

Many thanks for your words every week! Hope to hear from you soon.

Best Regards,
Hunter]]></description>

Hi Kim... think through this form James created as it applies to you... while your young... It could serve as a guide when life gets you a little Topsy Turvey! I scuba dive, sometimes I lose my bearings and don&#039;t know which way is up... If that happens, I blow bubbles and watch... because I know the bubbles always go up! A well defined sense of personal values will give you direction when you are disoriented in life, just like bubbles always showing the way up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/values-choices#comment-9036&quot;&gt;Quin Whitaker&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for pointing this out, Quin.

One of the problems I&#039;ve encountered in life is when I saw the wife of a very good friend out with, and being intimate with, another man. If my value is always to tell the truth, do I tell my friend about his wife if he tells me he has doubts about his wife&#039;s integrity and asks me what do I think? Or do I keep it to myself as it may have been a one-time only affair for his wife and she has seen the error and will now remain faithful. Then my telling will cause a lot of pain.

There must be other situations where this sort of occasion arises.

I do feel that what you do in life reflects what misery you could cause all in the name of principles and values. Sometimes you may have to compromise your values when other people are involved. It&#039;s a dilemma.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/values-choices#comment-9057&quot;&gt;Sherry&lt;/a&gt;.

This rings alarm bells for me. When you say &quot;we set our moral values&quot; do you mean setting values as a group or do you mean giving a list of values to pick from and letting the participant choose, or add their own, values and put them in writing for themselves, not, maybe, to even be shared with the group?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article James. I find another great way to define your values is to include the perceptions of others in the mix. Just the other day, a friend passed along a compliment of my qualities and what he valued about our friendship. It was grounding and helped me define my values. Another time this happened recently was at the wedding we both attended and having someone else explain what they thought meant most to me was indeed eye-opening. This is similar to the MBA survey students send out to their peers to conduct an assessment of skills and qualities.

I think the Aesop quote is an important one to point out the need to connect and reflect individually. This step can be supplemented with your peer network&#039;s input.

Keep up the good work!

Thanks Connie! I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the article.

And it&#039;s true -- the balance between values and money can be tough at times. Keep experimenting, working, and learning. Entrepreneurship and writing is a roller coaster ride. You&#039;ll get there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, James. I appreciate the time, thought, and clarity you put into writing this. It is always good to refocus on what is truly important in our lives before making decisions, especially big decisions. As a writer, I have sometimes felt the urge to write what I know will sell instead of what I feel compelled to share about the world through my writing. It is only through consideration of my values that keeps me on track. So far, however, it has not helped me to earn enough to become a full-time writer. Sometimes, considering both sides - values and money - is not so easy to reconcile. Thanks for your perspective, it is worthwhile working on it. 

Best regards, 
Connie Atkinson]]></description>
