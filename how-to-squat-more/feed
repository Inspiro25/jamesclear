					<description><![CDATA[Hey James, I need some help.  As much as I love squats, I love bench pressing and deadlift. I&#039;m 15 and I figured this would be a good age to start working out because of growing and all that. My main problem is I&#039;m weak, I max for bench 115, 205 for deadlift and 180 for squat. You said set your goal, well my goal for the past year was to improve on all 3 things drastically, like how your squat went from 170 to 350 type of drastic. I&#039;ve tried SO many programs that were just not good for me and a waste of time. Adding about 5 pounds to my max in a 3 month span. My main goal is to improve my bench. I&#039;m also going to follow your squat program so I can get good results. But if you can help me try to get those results in my DL, B and I&#039;d really appreciate it. If you read this then please respond.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/how-to-squat-more#comment-8845&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;.

Double bodyweight is a great goal for you Emily.  Google &#039;basic strength standards&#039; for a good guide to what level you are at - based on a female doing a bodyweight squat you are already intermediate.  A double bodyweight squat would place you well in the elite category and most people would expect to take at least 5 years to get to that stage.

Bear in mind the weights are 1RMs and you are really going to have to do some powerlifter style training rather than high rep stuff to get to that level.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, great article! I&#039;m a 5 foot 2 female and I do some weightlifting here and there, but nothing too serious. This summer, I want to focus on building my strength and I really want to squat 200 lbs. I weigh around 110 now and can squat about that much as well. Do you think this is a realistic goal? 

Also, I&#039;m wondering about going to the gym alone and not having anyone spot me. I have had times when I squat so low that if I didn&#039;t have a spotter to help me back up, I would have fallen over. Any tips on going solo?]]></description>
