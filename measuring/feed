					<description><![CDATA[More often than not what separates someone from achieving their goals or not is the ability to stay focused. Tracking and measuring progress can definitely help with that.

The act of tracking your progress can also help uncover more moments to celebrate your progress, as well as show you which actions or activities provide the best results.

Big fan, James!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/measuring#comment-10564&quot;&gt;Patrice&lt;/a&gt;.

I support Lu Ellen (above) and Patrice in their search for methods and techniques of tracking.
There is an app on the iPhone called Daily Goals which I find is good but I would like to improve my recording of events. Any suggestions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more about the importance of measuring your projects. 

Last year I had a project to &quot;have more deep meaningful relationships with those around me&quot;. But how should I measure if a relationship is deep and meaningful? First I though about how many and how often I open up to a person. My coach, however, said that it&#039;s better to involve a response from the other person if you want to measure a relationship. This approach is harder but mostly better (I think), I&#039;ll explain.

The two metrics I choose were &quot;How many different persons have opened up to me?&quot; and &quot;Total number of times someone opened up to me?&quot;. I then went on and defined &quot;When has a person opened up?&quot; and the criteria was a bit vague but when I felt that someone shared something private and scary with me.

This still required me to open up at least once to a person to get that person to open up, sometimes more than once. In addition it required me to listen inventively to see if the other person really shared something scary and personal.

For me this was my most successful project of 2013. I&#039;d say I&#039;m a totally different person now and thanks to I chose the harder path I&#039;m now a better listener and I can read body language a bit better. This would not have been possible if I hadn&#039;t measured my relationships.


On another note.

I&#039;d say you can still measure love, or rather make up your own definition. But you should know why you want to measure it and make it wide enough so that you don&#039;t get some skewed measurement that the amount of hugs you get from your spouse. :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, guy! I read your book about habits. I couldn&#039;t finish it, I just got up, laced up my sneakers, and went to the gym. :) 

It may sound stupid, but it really changed the way I looked at things in life. I woke up today and remembered of your nice writing and dropped by, and found this awesome text. Wow. I recently, like yesterday, decided to start measuring money. With the risk of sounding greedy, I recently got a raise and found myself not knowing where the money was going. And then I set aside loads of strategies on how to keep track of money (without money, you can&#039;t pay for the gym, and that would be a real issue). I got some real new knowledge here today, thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, this post was a big inspiration to me. As an educator, I&#039;ve been preaching the importance of measurement to my students as a way of becoming more aware of their growth and progress. Even though I work in the arts, there are plenty of opportunities to measure and quantify, with significant results. I just wrote about it on The SAVI Singing Actor (www.savisingingactor.com), and linked back to this post. Thanks for your consistent great work!]]></description>
