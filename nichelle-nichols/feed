					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading your site for a while, but never commented. But this piece made me.

James, I should say that about you. You touch so many lives all around the world, and even if you know that objectively, I do not think you can really understand how much value you give out to the world. 

This year, I am slowly transforming my habits, and all thanks to your articles about following the system, and about one coach saying it&#039;s all about who refuses to get bored of the daily routine. Thank you so much! Keep writing! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An excellent post, James. One point that I want to add: Sometimes people walk into our lives uninvited and change its trajectory for ever. Imagine the life of Nichelle and even all of us who are learning from it, if she had not met MLK.

Welcome uninvited guests!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, I was going to gloss over your article -- archive it into that &quot;read later&quot; pile that I never get to. In a fit of procrastination, I decided to read about Nichelle (of whom I&#039;m a big fan). Your article was inspiring and wonderful. You&#039;ve turned a rather dull Monday morning into a chance for me to really think about what I do and can do in a new light. Thank you so much!]]></description>
