That&#039;s wonderful, Mariel. Welcome back to the world of running. It sounds like you&#039;ve got the right approach and that you&#039;re building upon your habit each week. Keep that focus on doing it little by little and you&#039;ll get to where you want to be soon.

Good luck and thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/awareness-start-better-habits#comment-3228&quot;&gt;Lynn&lt;/a&gt;.

It sounds like you&#039;re doing exciting work, Lynn. I think you&#039;ve discovered an important piece of the puzzle: that it&#039;s the habits and psychology (and not necessarily the diet plan itself) that will make the biggest difference. 

Good luck getting your clients to master their habits. Hopefully my articles can help in some small way.

Thanks for reading.]]></description>

Thanks for the compliment, Rachel.

And yes, tracking can be fun. It depends on how you frame it in your mind. I view my tracking almost like mini-achievements. I&#039;m glad to hear that it&#039;s enjoyable for you.

Thanks for reading.]]></description>

I think those are all good strategies, Craig. I went through a similar process where I tried some tracking via software, but ended up eliminating it. It seems to work for certain things in my world, but not others. 

Regardless, what is most important is that you keep experimenting and tweaking things until you&#039;ve found a system that maximizes your happiness and success.

Good luck and thanks for reading.]]></description>

Thanks Brian. I especially like the distinction you made between awareness and letting go. A good balance of focused time and free time is always necessary.

As always, thanks for reading.]]></description>
