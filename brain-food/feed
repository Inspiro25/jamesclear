					<description><![CDATA[I had an extended hospital stay in March. My family brought in gossip magazines to read while I was hospitalized. I could not concentrate on more substantial reading. Before I knew I became interested in the lives of celebrities. The glossy pictures had a pull for me. I found that I was spending more and more time on celebrity websites and developing an unhealthy interest in their lives.

I have broken myself of this habit.  Boredom is the enemy. It was more difficult than I imagined to break myself of this habit. Looking at these sites and obsessing over these people just left me feeling empty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic article, it describes exactly my view on information through media. I haven&#039;t had a TV in my home for 10 years. I simply didn&#039;t buy a new one because soon after it broke down I became aware I did not miss my tv at all. I did not miss the information that came out of it because 99% isn&#039;t useful information that helps me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James -- thanks for all these lessons. I have not been a keen one on news, celebrities and the so so -- my husband thinks am weird not to be interested in what is happening in my country. I mostly read novels, articles on medical issues, cookery, community development, knitting and general handwork and taking new lessons as I am now learning to use a computer, help give free knitting and cookery lessons to women and youth... and take in a little of what takes place in the country... and now I have your interesting posts! I almost believed him. Thanks for your article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, thank you for your post. I consciously stopped watching the news after the most recent school shooting, about a year ago. The media has become so sensationalized. As a result, and not as much of a conscious decision, I began to phase out radio, newspapers, Facebook, and TV in general (no shows, no movies)...pretty much all media. The time I spend online is extremely focused and purposeful. Sometimes I&#039;m slightly embarrassed by how little I know about current events. But overall, I&#039;m pleased with my new way of like. One other downside is that it can be difficult to find things to talk about, especially at work events when &quot;chit-chat&quot; seems to be necessary. Any advice on career networking when you really have no idea what&#039;s happening in the world? I only recently found out about the government shut down and don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s back up and running. Have I gone too far?

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

Just wanted to say thank you for this article. It really resonated with me and made me stop and evaluate how I view my time and what I spend my time on.
