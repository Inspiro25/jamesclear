					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Karla for your message, please keep us updated on your progress. Amazing story.

I recently divorced my husband and five years ago I filed for restraining order and divorce and he has since turned some truth into all out lies and has gained custody of my children. My son is now 21 and my daughter is going to be 12 tomorrow. I now see my daughter every other weekend and one day during the week. Since losing them I have felt hollow but crippled with fear of my ex (who always threatens that he holds the court card and can make changes anytime) and the anger I have for the whole family law justice system. I keep saying I am not going to give up on getting my daughter back so it is time that I stop letting a man or anyone else take away my hope to fight and take back what is mine. My dignity, self worth and a daughter who needs a strong mommy.

Please keep me and my two children in your prayers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A comment to thank you for this post that helped a great deal in my time of need. 

I don&#039;t know if you will, or even want to read why and how was your article uselful, but if you do... here&#039;s my little story.

When I was a kid, I was different, doing everything with ease, except that I wasn&#039;t able to socialize because of this difference. People kept telling me I wasn&#039;t speaking their language. Hated me because they thought I did this on purpose. Thought it would pass. It didn&#039;t, especially when my IQ results came back. The man said at least 165 but thought it was underated. It grew worse, and I wasn&#039;t feeling particularily clever. Everything, excepted those social issues were fine.

Then I went to high school. I was the first of my class in almost everything, without doing anything. I never revised, nor did my homework. But I was listening, and was fascinated by everything. I only needed to read or hear something once to remember it, and understand it. I was especially passionate about science. As a kid, I watched Star Trek, Stargate, and read Asimov, Douglas Adams, among others. I wanted to become a scientist. I was convinced then, and still am, that my purpose on this earth was to bring a contribution to science. Let&#039;s do better than Einstein. He did stuff. Why couldn&#039;t I, right? And they say I am supposed to be clever? It should help. I wanted to learn as much as I could, discover as much as I could, and teach what I had learned and discovered to anyone who would listen.

Then, I had this math teacher. A nice young woman. Nothing to complain about. But then came that horrible day... she wrote a demonstration on the board of some theorem. From the first line I knew there was something wrong. Couldn&#039;t put my finger on it, but there was a mistake that made the whole thing wrong. She didn&#039;t notice it, and I kept looking for what gave me that feel. A moment before she was done, I whispered it was wrong. I think out loud a lot. When I write, I whisper what I am thinking. I talk to myself a lot to organize my thinking (alone of course - I don&#039;t need that extra weirdness to be cast aside even more).  But the thing is, I was seating right in front of her desk. And she heard it. She turned and gave me the chalk, challeging me to correct her.

Well, let&#039;s say I know I should have stayed seated at that precise moment. But I was still deep in thoughts. And mecanically it took the chalk, erased the whole thing and set it right before I returned to my seat. I wasn&#039;t thinking about the consequence really (I rarely do, precisely because I am often deep in thoughts). But the demonstration I did was right. She acknowledged her mistake, and it was then I realized that I actually had written the whole thing on the board. She thought it amused me to mock her and... the nightmare started.

Every math lesson for the two years that came after this event, was a marathon of mockery. Trying to undermine me. Every time I made a mistake (I am human, not a damn machine) that was the horror. And slowly, she reached her goal: She eventualy broke me. I wasn&#039;t able to do anything anymore, because I was always in doubt. Couldn&#039;t take decisions, couldn&#039;t solve even the easiest of exercises, because I always doubted. My grades sank with my confidence. I don&#039;t think I ever was overconfident. I just knew stuff and trusted my memory and logical mind.

In the end, my grades were so low that I even thought I wouldn&#039;t manage to pass my degree. And yes, for a boy who loved maths and physics, it was astounding to get such low grades. But still, I got it. Wasn&#039;t satisfied though. No distinction.

Then I went to college. Only to see that even with her gone, something had truly been shattered inside. I was doubting more than ever on everything. Couldn&#039;t do anything right. Was stressed beyond imagining. Slowly, the situation went worse. Listening wasn&#039;t enough to understand and master a subject any more. So... I did what I never did before: I worked my lessons. Before meeting that teacher, I used the time one would usually allocate for lessons and homework, for learning more. I always wanted more. But now, it had to stop. Because I wasn&#039;t able to understand my lessons anymore. But why? I felt inside me it was still as easy as it ever was. A part of me still worked that way. I knew I had all the answers somewhere, but couldn&#039;t reach them. I felt dumb because of that. Always thinking: &quot;Come on, what&#039;s taking so long, that&#039;s easy! What are you stuck on?!&quot;, &quot;Why are you reading that lesson again? You already know everything about it! What part didn&#039;t you understand?&quot;. But it wasn&#039;t working. I was unable to use my damn brain properly. So I had bad and worse grades. And with each bad grade, another voice in my head was speaking to me, each time stronger &quot;You&#039;re stupid. You&#039;re an idiot. You&#039;ll never succeed. You are a waste.&quot; to the point when I started to believe that voice over the other one that was hinting me I could do it.

I felt really bad, but on the other hand, people had grown up. I was in college, with a bunch of geeks, I managed to socialize for the first time in my life.  The friends I made helped me through those hardships. Helped me in keeping me going. But that didn&#039;t solve my problems with doubt, stress, lack of confidence. Until, one day, I found a book in the library of my campus about Fermat&#039;s last theorem. Even if I couldn&#039;t understand much anymore because of doubt, my hunger for knowledge, especially for maths and physics was still there. I read it, and started working on demonstrating it. This particular theorem wasn&#039;t demonstrated before the 90&#039;s by a mathematician named Andrew Wiles, who received the Field&#039;s medal (equivalent of a nobel prize) for that, since it had remained unsolved for about three hundred years. Fermat wrote it on some book, saying he had a very good demonstration for it but had no time to write it. (The guy was a judge, and maths were his hobby. He had a ton of great ideas, had proofs for some of them, but didn&#039;t take time to write them all down. His &quot;last theorem&quot; is one of those missing demonstrations).

But, something bothered me. Wiles&#039; solution, like all the &quot;simplified&quot; versions that came after were using mathematical concepts that are very recent. Not even fantacised in the epoch of Fermat. And yet, he claimed to have a solution. So, I started looking for it on my free time, with a newly found enthusiasm (I love solving problems - I always thought of those as a game). The more the solution eluded me, the more exciting it became. It started showing in college, I was regaining confidence, and everyone thought I was under the influence, because I could finish great amounts of work in very little time, like before I met my high school math teacher. This change increased gradually, and peaked when I found the solution. Eureka and all that (I could write lines of how extatic that moment was). After checking multiple times, I contacted Andrew Wiles to have his opinion on the matter, thinking that after all he had devoted his life to this problem, if there is anyone I should talk to about that, it&#039;s him. He mailed me back, enthusiastic. For a couple of weeks, i felt like I had wings. I regained full confidence in myself, thinking that I had to be good to have solved something that remained unsolved for so long. Not feeling clever still, but feeling like I am &quot;confidenceworthy&quot;. That I can trust my abilities, because I accomplished something that some great minds have failed on. (Though the &quot;bad&quot; voice kept saying it was luck. That an idiot with luck could have done it. This isn&#039;t entirely false - but not true either - after all aren&#039;t many discoveries made out of luck? A piece of the puzzle appearing differently in a given context that allows you to solve it?).

But there&#039;s a thing... publishing a mathematical demonstration is like writing a small thesis. It must be easily understandable, and everything must be justified by a proven theory. In my case, I thought it would be easy - the maths I used are as old as Euclid&#039;s work. But there are two things wrong: Two things I thought to be proven, that are still unproven to this day (even though, those are conjectures, they check up in every known case, but there is no proper demonstration to those yet).

So, until these two conjectures are properly demonstrated, I am stuck. It isn&#039;t a big deal, right? I can wait for someone to publish the demonstrations, and then publish mine? I can even work on those, who knows, I could manage to demonstrate those? Even if my solution isn&#039;t published yet because of that... I still have something that should check up. But that little uncertainty was enough to let everything break down in my mind again: Gone confidence, welcome back stress. Bye joy. Hello depressiveness.

And from that point on, it started going down again. But at least I had the memory of this &quot;great period&quot; to confort me, and make me look up on occasions. But it wasn&#039;t enough, and I started sinking again.

But then I found this article. Combined with a close to infinite amount of talks with familiy, friends, psychiatrists, teachers... I was able to end this chapter thanks to this article, it found echo deep inside me and... things have been going better since then. This time it&#039;s going to last though. Last time it was because of a particular event that I had that &quot;boost&quot;. But this time it&#039;s the result of a long journey toward vanishing my fears - inner demons - whatever you call them. And for that, I am eternally grateful to you, sir. 

(P.S: Sorry for my bad english, but expressing all this was hard, finding the words, formulating... even in my native language I have trouble explaining that.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this.

I have been paralyzed by my fear of failing and wanting so badly to try to go after the things I love, such as writing and photography.  I have been thinking well if I do this first then...  But I am unraveling that fear (which hurts like a mofo) so I can just start and be and allow myself to be a beginner.

This is exactly what I needed to read today.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I came to work after 2 days of minor health problem and all of a sudden while on the way to work I started having that sinking feeling of negativity and pessimism of not being an achiever or what the hell am I doing at 38 or I&#039;m at the wrong place and should not be wasting my life over something that I don&#039;t really love doing.

As I read your article James, its really as if a messenger of God wrote to me telling me directly in the face how inaccurate I am and its like an eye-opener.

In fact there were 4 of your newsletters and each one was like a voice of God. Though my trivia still continues to exist, I feel somewhat relaxed and at ease.

Thank You man. God Bless You.]]></description>
