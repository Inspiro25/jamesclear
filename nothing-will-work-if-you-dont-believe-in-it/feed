					<description><![CDATA[I can appreciate your thought process ... yet I am at a point where the believe in myself has been reduced to rubble during the last 8 months ... where literally everything I touched professionally has failed.  

So in my mind I have &quot;proven&quot; to myself that I did fail ... I know eventually I&#039;ll hopefully snap out of it again ... but for the time being all advice is being met with a cynical grin ... especially on the benefits of having a positive mind ... trust me I had it for the longest time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I happen to come across this article on Thanksgiving exactly one year later.  I am one of many that had to work during the holiday, and as I was sitting at my desk I just kept thinking of how angry I was at myself for not having the courage to pursue another job, and to change the things in my life that make me the most unhappy.  I am what is standing in my way of believing in myself and in believing I can change things for the better. I know what I have to do, but it is already set in my mind that I will fail. I often look back at times that I did manage to overcome several obstacles and thought, &quot;If I was able to overcome this before I can do it again. I am more stronger than I realize.&quot; But these thoughts are often overshadowed by the belief that the negative experiences have outweighed the positive, that I&#039;m not the type of person that will continue to experience positive things in life.  I think what makes me continue to hold on to the belief that I cannot change things for the better is my comparing myself to my mother. She suffers from life long depression, and is absolutely unwilling to change the things in her life that make her unhappy. She is afraid of things she does not know and things that will take her life in a different direction, and I believe that I share this same fear. I would like to think that I do often take steps to improve myself, such as going to therapy, reaquainting myself with activities I enjoy doing, even reading articles such as this to get advice. But I ultimately go back to the belief that if my mom can&#039;t change, what makes me think that I can do any better. The fear trying to change things is absolutely crippling, and the determination to try is drifting further away. So on this holiday I am thankful that I came across this article, a good reminder that I am the one that has the power to change things]]></description>
