					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,
         I love these articles. Your writing is crystal clear and to the point. More importantly they are very useful and easy to understand. I love the drawings, simple and powerful. I very often think in pictures just like them. I especially liked the &quot;1% Rule&quot;, and am looking for different ways to apply it to my life, as well as with fitness. I listen to dozens of podcasts, but I read only one blog,that&#039;s yours. Enjoy your time off and thanks for the great work.    Jim :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post James - I love the &quot;2 minute rule&quot; since it works great in tricking the mind. Hehe. 

Point remains that people are inherently not motivated to do stuff since beyond our deficit needs (food, shelter, sleep, social) our brain is pre-programmed to conserve energy. Hence why in a social system it&#039;s much more common that people opt out of work and simply live on welfare. We&#039;re plants by default.

Athletic pursuits, building businesses, self-actualization? - Not really a priority for our brain, is it? But then again since you&#039;re in a blind pursuit for short-term pleasure you get other diseases like obesity, depression and so-on.

The only way is up - right? Re-programming your instinctive brain is essential these days, glad you&#039;re helping me man!

&quot;We&#039;re bound by the chains of our instinctual programming - unless overcome - we&#039;re predestined for decay&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James Clear,  I&#039;m glad I stumbled upon your blog!

You&#039;re a very engaging writer; your ideas are great, and so clearly expressed in a straightforward, visual way that really makes sense to me. I&#039;ve signed up,  and am looking forward to reading that free download book. I might just get my condo cleaned today after all! 

I&#039;m hoping you have a Facebook group, or page at least.

Really looking forward for more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stumbled upon this site looking for some info on physics to draw metaphors to productive habits and am glad your site has what I was looking for and more.  

I LOVE how you explained the concepts very simply and yet so powerfully.  Glad I found this - I&#039;ll be consuming more of this content to fuel my entrepreneurial journey. 

Thanks!

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes my 2 minute kick-start is just opening a file on my computer and getting out a pen and paper. At times even that is difficult to do, so I really have to psych myself into opening the file. But once it&#039;s open and I&#039;m looking at it, things start to unfold.

Thanks for posting - interesting take on productivity!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great analogy. I could further the dimensions that it is extended to by saying that knowledge is what gives one the potential energy to overcome static friction and obstacle would otherwise contribute to frictional losses. 

Because Newton&#039;s laws were suggested based on the system in a vacuum environment, your proposed laws of occupational physics could equate/relate air resistance to the distractions we have and will experience in our own environment.]]></description>
