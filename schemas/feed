					<description><![CDATA[BINGO! Once again, thanks, James.  You often seem to just know where my mind is and what I am thinking.  Throwing up blocks to a new business?  Most likely. Going to resume daily application without keeping track of depth or quality -- just daily application. Listen to a new voice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A great article. It reminded me of breaking old habits like always seeing the glass half empty. It also reminded me of the many superstitious things my ancestors brought with them from Italy.

As I have seen, as you age, it gets harder to break schemes, step out of your shoes and see the world from a different perspective. But it&#039;s always worth a try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, this is an important topic, so thanks for about it. We can use a schema as a way to help us learn new things, connecting what we already know and have experienced, to new experiences and ideas. I wrote about this on my blog: http://convergenceinthecommons.com/2013/03/21/using-a-schema-to-understand-haiti/, with relation to how a schema helps us become a better reader. So a particular schema may not just be a problem - as you suggest in your article - it may also be a way of framing something new.

Thanks again for this topic!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a saying, &quot;You know what you know. You know what you don&#039;t know. But you don&#039;t know what you don&#039;t know.&quot;

How can you change something you don&#039;t know or aren&#039;t even aware of, as needing changing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post James. I really connected with it, especially with my current decision. A very good friend of mine is getting married in Chicago, I live in Alaska, and just started Grad school. I want to do exceptionally well in my studies so part of me tells myself, don&#039;t go, you&#039;ll have trouble with school when you return and the other part of me says...GO! You see, she recently lost her father and if it were me, the more of my friends around me the better! Have you been faced with something like this? If so, how did you make your choice?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a grown woman who is just beginning to climb out of some of the results of a poor relationship with an emotionally controlling parent and older religious sister when I was growing up. I have learned enough to know that once I realize the bad effects of some of their behaviors on me, I can dispense with blame and move on becoming the person I want to be. However, it can difficult be to see beyond the picture that others have painted of you; you can think them unfair and even mean-spirited but still be under the influence of them. It is interesting to me how many people become hateful towards belief in a God because of the foolishness of religious people. For me, in spite of being the victim of misguided and hateful religious foolishness in my sister, it has been my belief that has helped me break free of her control. It is knowing we are, none of us, ever totally &quot;right&quot; but we are known and loved truly by someone bigger.  

I have really benefited from reading your blogs for the short time I&#039;ve been getting them. Thank you for your work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/schemas#comment-2526&quot;&gt;Christina Waldman&lt;/a&gt;.

I really like what you said here, Christina. What stood out the most for me was when you said the two year old may need nurtured/hugged. I had very strict/harsh parents and I tend to &#039;blast&#039; the many two year olds still raging inside me, when perhaps they need to be treated with some care and respect so they can (finally) grow. (I&#039;m tearing up so it&#039;s probably true - the little buggers just want some kindness and love). I&#039;m glad you shared your thoughts. Thank you.]]></description>
