					<description><![CDATA[The questions that have caused me to wrestle with burying my gifts and talents for a number of years are: Will they be needed, useful or make a real difference in the world? If so, how do I share what I have with the lives that will be most impacted?

I&#039;m encouraged! Even if I don&#039;t know all the &#039;how&#039;s&#039; quite yet, I&#039;ll never know the difference I can make unless I try. Thank you for taking the time and effort to write articles like this that truly inspire! The world is (and will be) better for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a very important article. Thank you very much James! Lately, I&#039;ve been asking myself this: &quot;Josephine, with everything that you know and can do, what good is it when you don&#039;t do it?&quot; Recently my friends told me that I should check Emma Watson&#039;s speech in the UN, two questions she would propose to herself when she is hesitant to do the work she feels she is called to do: 1. If not me, then WHO? 2. If not now, WHEN?&quot;

For what Jitu says about learning from our elders. This is very true. Part of my work in the Philippines is to create projects where we can still be nourished by the stories and values of the elders. We are a country in transition but I&#039;d like to believe that with the work my peers and I are doing now, certain inherited forms that do not work in our society can be consciously changed and re-built. 

Thank you James for keeping me on track. Been teeter-tottering on slippery slopes and your article provides a much needed chiropractic re-alignment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too am guilty of postponing the possibility of sharing my photos. There seems to be an irrational fear but for me it is real.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this inspiration, James. I make handmade photoframes and want to make them reach people but I am very very skeptical on going out there and selling them. This article has filled some courage within me. I am very grateful to you for sharing this. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James! Hi everybody else :) 

I saw the title of this post and knew I had to read it. I&#039;m currently really battling with a problem like this. I write, I draw, I take photographs, and I think. In my spare time (and even in the time that isn&#039;t really spare!) I dedicate myself to my passions. Writing in particular. 

Over the last few months my frustration levels have reached alarming new heights. This may sound big headed, but I know my talent is being wasted. It makes me so upset. My heart is heavy with the burden of the things I do not share. I want to share my work, a few times I have tried. I don&#039;t know what keeps stopping me in my tracks, its fear obviously, I guess its the fear of the unknown. I wouldn&#039;t know where to start in attempt to get my writing published. I don&#039;t feel like its finished either, so I would be too embarrassed to ask someone to look at it and give any kind of constructive advice.. Its all over the place!? A job half done. But I think there&#039;s talent there! 

I just read another article of yours about a lady who catches a cab every morning to her two hour workout. You spoke about how the ritual was not the workout itself but instead catching the cab. The point was, its easier to finish once you&#039;ve started, than it is to start. Maybe this is similar?

Its unknown because I haven&#039;t made myself familiar... And the only way to do that is to start? 

Oh golly. Wish me luck! One day I will stop being my own worst enemy. Thanks for the posts by the way, your truly inspiring.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, what a moving story that is about Vivian Maier.  It is true, until you put yourself out there with a project, business idea or invention, you can&#039;t fully appreciate your abilities.  Some will fail and others will succeed.  The success of my recently published children&#039;s book has motivated me to write more and continue delivering the kind of education and motivation my book has inspired.  I have two more projects in the works and feel better about my abilities as a writer and as a person.  

Thanks, James]]></description>
