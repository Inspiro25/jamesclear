					<description><![CDATA[James, great article as usual. This reminds me of a previous post in which you say (paraphrasing) &quot;Not every article is Pulitzer material, not every workout will be a PR, but if you keep showing up, some will be.&quot; This has been very helpful for me. It helps me not make the second mistake to remember and visualize a time I showed up and killed it. Conversely, when I remember the first mistake and focus on it, I tend to make the second mistake. Even with your tips above, if your mind stays on the negatives and the mistakes, you repeat them.

Glad I&#039;ve read enough of your articles to cross reference the excellent techniques.

Keep up the fantastic work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/second-mistake#comment-13217&quot;&gt;Tess Binns&lt;/a&gt;.

Tess, I am not a big fan of the flavor of coffee, but do enjoy the benefits in the morning when I need a jolt.

I am a big fan into chocolate. I don&#039;t know if protein powder is your thing, but there are some great tasting, relatively cheap, and healthy chocolate options. I can get the caffeine and warmth of the coffee, satisfy the chocolate craving, and add more protein to my diet. It likely won&#039;t be &quot;the same&quot; as your 7/11 mocha, but maybe it can suffice and not drive your health nut side crazy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s helpful to think about those &quot;mistakes&quot; as it&#039;s written down in instruction leaflets for meds: If you forget to take the pill one day, don&#039;t panic. Just take it again next time as scheduled, nothing bad happening when you&#039;ve skipped the last one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could say this is a faster way than making a group of mistakes and trying to start all over again with a much higher success rate. It also depends on the kind of mistake, whether it is a mistake by doing or by not doing something.

In either case it&#039;s still about consistency. As long as you can ignore your mistakes and get yourself back on track, you&#039;re all good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another awesome post, just when I needed it. Thank you! I would add to your list of examples mine from today:

Thinking you are a lousy parent cos you ranted at your kids when you were tired and hungry. 

I like how you mention getting back on track and avoiding getting into a pattern of mistakes. Time for me to focus on the basics - regular meals, enough sleep and time to relax for us all. 

Thanks again.]]></description>
