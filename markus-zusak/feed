					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, James, for reminding me to stick with it! I took up oil painting 3 short years ago, with absolutely zero art knowledge or experience.  Since that time I have improved, by doing just what you said. Painting, painting, painting! Watching instructional videos, reading tips.

I haven&#039;t arrived (I think no artist ever truly does) but with each painting I try to get just a little better. 

I am thankful to Kevin Knebl for posting a reference to your article on his FB page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/markus-zusak#comment-11160&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi friends,

I agree that TRYING means that you do not have it, since our beliefs creates everything including creativity, then TRYING means a belief of not having.

On the other hand I do agree that practice will generate creativity, because in time it becomes a habit, and so you stop TRYING, it become who you are, you show up each day to your work and you are not TRYING any more, but you are working on it because it has  become who you are. 

And when you are in a habit and have stop TRYING and it became who you are, then creativity will flow and be expressed naturally and regularly. 

So you both are right. :-)

Allen

					<description><![CDATA[Loved the points you make in this article. I do think there is a misconception about anyone at the top of their game in nearly any field, especially a creative one, that it&#039;s mostly about some God-given talent. As demonstrated over and over again, creativity without tenacity can often lead nowhere. I find that usually, when you see someone doing something, and making it look easy, it&#039;s  because it&#039;s masking the years and years of practice, self-sacrifice, and work ethic that has elevated him or her to the peak. And of course, there are always new peaks! Thanks for a great perspective!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/markus-zusak#comment-11157&quot;&gt;Joseph&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Joseph,

I couldn&#039;t possibly predict how his work might have turned out.

What I&#039;m suggesting though is not that we don&#039;t try, nor that grit and practice doesn&#039;t produce creative work, but rather &#039;trying&#039; to be creative through &#039;grit and practice&#039; as opposed to allowing what naturally flows to unfold in a creative way is where the magic of creativity truly takes place.

When we get out of our own heads and operate from a clear mind we tend to do a lot better than when we&#039;re thinking about each step of the process. 

Hard work and practice most definitely does make us better at our craft but as I see it, the ability to be &#039;creative&#039; comes from a different place.]]></description>
