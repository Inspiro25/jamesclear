					<description><![CDATA[Inspriration surrounds us if we know how to look. Job well done. I was thinking about something you might want to consider. First I will say, sometimes when someone tells me thier idea for me based on viewing or talking about my art, I think nice but it isn&#039;t my vision. But, sometimes I get a comment that rocks or rattles my world. My favorite saying that Bruce Lee said:&quot; Absorb what is useful, discard what is not,add what is uniquely your own&quot;.Have you thought about adding some of your photos in your book you are writing? They say,&quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. The book I just finished by Austin Kleon is filled with his drawings to get his point across. Lori]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James - Your pictures from the Rocky Mountain caused me to pause. That in itself is quite something. The fly fisherman, and the lone elk are photos on which I could meditate. Dusk at Sprague Lake is very peaceful. Thanks for sharing these beautiful photos.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/photo-essay-colorado#comment-10808&quot;&gt;Sam Davies&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks! And yes, I always shoot in RAW (Canon 6D camera with 40mm lens for the photos above). For processing, I take a first look in Lightroom and then finish in Photoshop. I used to process images a lot (my old photos look over-processed to me now), but now I don&#039;t do very much. Now I usually do some exposure tweaks in Lightroom and adjust Levels and Sharpening in Photoshop. That&#039;s about it.]]></description>
