					<description><![CDATA[This was an amazing article. I can&#039;t lie I&#039;m going through some tough criticism and hate from all kinds of people: people who I thought to be friends, people who smile in my face and shake my hand at work, and all kinds of people.

Long story short, I loved your article and it did indeed make me feel better about my situation and it did give me tips how to handle any present and future situations. Your article was great and I will definitely subscribing or going  through the rest of your website. Keep it up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post. After receiving some hate mail I got inspired to write my first blog post on dealing with criticism. I wanted to read about other people&#039;s experiences and I stumbled upon your blog. So happy I did! I used a few of your quotes and gave you a shoutout. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for writing this article. I couldn&#039;t agree more. I do find that it&#039;s a journey and that when you try to live your life by lifting others up there is always a bench sitter who will try to get you benched.

Keep writing, my husband and I are reading and learning!]]></description>
