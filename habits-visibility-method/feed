					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this article. I have been trying to come up with ways to help me drink more water, exercise more &#038; several other things. I&#039;m so glad I found this info &#038; can&#039;t wait to set up my environment, and make it work for me. My mom gave me a good idea to try and help me smoke less, thought I would share. She said to only smoke a cig on the hour so if it&#039;s 4:05 I missed my cig break &#038; have to wait until 5pm to have one. Seems to be a great idea, I didn&#039;t realize how much time I wasted smoking. I have children so I don&#039;t smoke inside and wasn&#039;t getting enough done inside because I spent so much time outside. I&#039;ve been getting a lot more done &#038; I also started keeping my pack hidden after reading your article which has also helped me cut down.

Thanks for the great info.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits-visibility-method#comment-274&quot;&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve got checking mind mapping/note taking software in my to do list for a while now. This is definitely a really bad habit. I was stuck in it for so long, and it&#039;s just recently that I realized that. I used to be a consumption machine that hoped to just pick something.

I wish I could have read your words earlier. It&#039;s just reassuring at this point, because I think this trap is so easy to fall into and many people don&#039;t realize it

Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like your posts, James, so to the point and applicable.

I was at the dentist this morning and he told me a trick about flossing that I wanted to share with you. He said that I should floss BEFORE brushing my teeth. Because this way you make sure that toothpaste reaches more areas afterwards when you brush and more importantly in terms of creating a habit - because you will always brush your teeth after flossing, but you won&#039;t necessarily think you need to floss after brushing your teeth. Little trick that I&#039;m planning to test. Perhaps you&#039;re already doing this? It was a little light bulb for me and I&#039;m now holding tightly on to the thought that this is what will make my habit of flossing stick (even if in reality it might not be much of a psychological difference!) :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James great post. Your approach a very similar process on how I made flossing a habit. However, I made it to hard for myself at the beginning.

Since I was flossing and using mouthwash and only the mouthwash was visible. So the pattern was to the wash then floss. It was working great until I ran out of mouthwash.

Since my workflow was broken I stop flossing. Afterwards I dropped the mouth wash and make the floss visible.

So now I am flossing regularly again. Now I make sure I have at least two boxes of floss so I never run out.]]></description>

Savvy! I&#039;m all for longer showers, so your idea is a great one.

p.s. Hey friend! Thanks for reading. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, James. The visibility method is powerful. I have a good flossing hack to contribute - I put my floss in the shower! Offering a few more more guilt-free minutes in a hot shower, flossing is suddenly an attractive option and I don&#039;t forget anymore. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits-visibility-method#comment-275&quot;&gt;Tammy R&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Tammy,

There&#039;s an interesting idea by Eben Pagan, that it takes much more effort to actively stop doing the bad things than to do the good things. The solution in this case is to focus our willpower on doing the right things and let the bad things take care of themselves.

Admittedly, this does not work in every situation, but I had really great results with this approach for increasing productivity. For example, I would focus on several key items I need to do on that day and wouldn&#039;t get angry on myself if after doing them I would engage in something &quot;bad&quot;.

Interestingly, over the course of several months I noticed a significant rise in the time spent doing &quot;good&quot; things and in turn the amount of time spent doing &quot;bad&quot; things decreased without making conscious effort.

For eating this would mean to focus on fulfilling hunger with good foods/drinks. It&#039;s really much easier to resist junk food when we&#039;re feeling satisfied. :)

Maybe this approach can be applied in your situation too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Spot on!

Just recently I swapped a bowl of chocolates with a bowl of oranges. Now, I never really liked sweets, but just as with your example with cookies, whenever I passed the table I would take one. Not surprisingly, after swapping, I started eating way more oranges :)

I actually did this without taking into consideration the effect on my diet, oranges just looked more aesthetically on the table, but it makes perfect sense now.

Rather intrigued with this, wonder what else I can find in how my surroundings affect my actions.

Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for making this process easier, James.  I am really good at making things visible, but I&#039;m not so good at making bad habits harder for myself.  I suppose if I think about it I have made eating anything unhealthy very inconvenient by not having it in the house.  I hope I can find other examples.  Just saying Visibility Method will help me weed through those habits - both good and bad - one at a time.]]></description>
