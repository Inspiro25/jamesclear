Changing the eating window is typically what women do to make it better for them health-wise. Typically, for men, it&#039;s eat all your calories in a 4-hour window with one big meal during the day. 

For women this is usually changed to 8 hours with two smaller meals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me IF was the way to go for many years in my life without doing it based on any protocol. I was always used to skip breakfast drinking a coffee and eating my lunch in that way I was felling more productive during the morning and energized. I still gained a lot of weight the last 2 by eating and drinking a lot around 45kgs. this year I decided to change so I started working out with heavy weights and counting my macro intake. I lost a huge amount of weight but my progress stalled around the 13% I was advised and trying to stick with the general belief of 6 meals -- 5 meals but it doest working for me I was feeling very hungry and exhausted. After some thought I jumped back on IF it helped me control craving and I work out fasted in the morning and doing carb cycling I reached 10% body fat (Leangains protocol) and I feel more energetic than ever also IF helped me with bloating and other gastro problems I had! As it is said, everyone seems to be different so you have to listen to your body and do whatever feels better for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I Totally agree. 

I&#039;ve been doing 6 small well ballanced meals a day and it was SO hard for me, i&#039;ve gave a chance to this and my life it&#039;s much more simple and I see now food like the thing it is: fuel, and not something to enjoy. I can say that I was near to an eating disorder, obsessed with eat every 3 hours.

I still count calories and keep my sources healthy and this makes it so simple.

I recommend anyone who is in a good health shape to give it a try, we don&#039;t have to believe everything that supplement industries want to sell us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great piece James!

Intermittent Fasting is something I&#039;ve been utilizing for years myself and it is working great. Having read many scientific journals on the topic recently, I&#039;m even more confident now, that IF is probably one of the best sustainable dieting approaches out there. Actually, I don&#039;t really want to call it a diet at all, but rather a lifestyle choice.

I&#039;ve even managed to hit the bodybuilding stage using IF, so yeah, it can be used  by anyone for sure. It may not be for everyone, but I think most people should try it out at-least once.

Personally I also tend to use the 16:8 pattern, but sometimes I change it up to as low as 12/12 or higher like 20:4. Recently I&#039;ve also gone more towards Brad Pilon&#039;s method, which is utilizing a roughly 24 hour fast 1-2x a week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like he said, research , and try it out on yourself, because everyone is different. I have been doing it for, like 5 months. I have lost like 3 pds, but, it&#039;s because, I basically eat whatever I want within the 8 hrs. I walk everyday, but I don&#039;t do weights enough, just once a week. So, like he said, you need healthy eating, weights, and this, if it helps you. It helps me because, I was gaining steadily every month, and now I am not. I drink coffee or tea, until 12:00. And than I eat.  I eat 2 meals, and a small snack in the middle. Because, I have to quit after 8 hrs. I no longer continue to nonstop snack, and this is an easy way to eat, for me. I can control myself,  because the door is closed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, It is actually a practical question about intermittent fasting:
 
All my life I have heard bad things about going to sleep on a full stomach so I sort of in for not eating anything after lets say 6pm as food digested thereafter may burden your stomach during the sleeping hours. If we buy into this theory at all, would it make sense to honoring this to slightly adjust your eating window shifting it from 10am to 6pm still keeping it for 8 hours and eating all you can during this time but not eating after 6pm (or later depending on your curfew habits)? 

Thanks a mill,
Zoltan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Thanks for sharing. I saw this on Lifehacker and clicked over. I started IF December 1 of last year and have shed 115 pounds so far. Another 20 and I&#039;ll have reached a goal that has been outside my grasp for 30+ years. 

My particular form of IF was &quot;Fast 5&quot; for most of the last year. Eating unrestricted but for only 5 continuous hours daily. It took a couple of weeks to adjust but then it was so simple and effortless to follow. As I&#039;ve come closer to my goal I&#039;ve expanded the eating window slightly and although it has slowed, the weight loss has continued at a healthy rate.

My doctor was skeptical but supportive of my &quot;experiment.&quot; She now is in awe of my results and my health is better than it has been for decades. After 20+ years on high blood pressure medication, I&#039;m no longer on any prescription medications.

As you said, it may or may not work for any individual. But taking the time to do some self-experimentation and finding what works for you is rewarding beyond measure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I too have experimented with a number of IF protocols. Most recently I experimented with the 16/8 protocol you mention here and the same exact feeding window. I included a full testosterone panel and RMR testing in my benchmarks. Both decreased rather significantly. I must note that I was periodically training both Olympic lifting, and occasionally CrossFit during my fasted period but more frequently in my fed period. There are confounding factors that I believe I have identified as causing the testosterone drop, however I can say with confidence (but not certainty) that IF caused the drop in RMR because I corrected and controlled for those factors in the final 40 days of of my experiment. I was also eating more than adequate calories and not losing weight during the test. was wondering if you tracked any additional data beyond what your recent bloodworm shows?

I also want to comment that I agree completely on points 1, 2, 4, and 5. It is actually hard for me now to implement breakfast into my schedule!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Being Indian, fasting for long periods is not alien. So many of us do some kind of fasting every week, on a designated day, month after year, without making too big a deal of it!

Yours is a practical, sensible sort of method, and should be very easy. I can vouch for the fact that is very easy to not eat for many hours, and then eat for some. Have never really kept a chart, but I now intend to.

Just a small Q: do you not have tea/coffee/any beverage upon waking, and eat/drink straight at 1 pm? What&#039;s your wake up strategy then? Just plain water? What about those of us have tea and some nuts and fruits? I then go straight through till 12 pm, and then 7 pm.

Would be nice to get a response.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found your post via Lifehacker, but had read some of your posts before. Thanks for sharing your experience!

I&#039;ve also experimented with intermittent fasting, and played with different a five hour window, an eight hour window, and alternate day fasting. I&#039;m female, so I&#039;m not sure if that played into things, but those just didn&#039;t work for me. I got too hungry, was exhausted, etc. About two months ago I started a modified alternate day fasting method based on Michael Mosley&#039;s book, and so far it&#039;s going great. For women, this might be a strategy that would work.

Your mileage may vary, of course!]]></description>
