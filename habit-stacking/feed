					<description><![CDATA[Hi james,

Not to mention, a very nice post as usual. One thing I noticed, this post doesn&#039;t have links to your other posts as you do most of the time. You should keep that habit of interlinking the articles, it always help!

BR,

					<description><![CDATA[Great post with straightforward actions. I am glad you made sure to remind the reader to habit stack in a homogeneous manner focusing on habits that can build upon one another seamlessly because of length of duration or energy investment.

Is there a final end goal that your whole day is habit stacked and feels like smooth sailing or is there room for some chaos and unplanned free time?

					<description><![CDATA[For sure that&#039;s the best way to start new habits, but James, if I want to break a bad habit, should I stack a good one on it? For example, before I bite my nails I will say one thing I&#039;m grateful for that day.

Thanks for the reflection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great info James. Thanks! I am working to break my habit of chocolate after lunch and will change it for a moment of meditation.

One more benefit. When we do things that are new to us, it helps to keep our brain&#039;s healthy and decrease the likelihood of issues as we age. The more different a new task or habit, the more benefit! The better news is that we don&#039;t need to be good at it, just do something different.]]></description>
