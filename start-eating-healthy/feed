I&#039;m right there with you. And you&#039;re spot on with the lack of willpower reference. You&#039;ll often hear people say, &quot;you just need self&#8211;control&quot; but between everyday decisions and stress our willpower can be drained incredibly quickly.

Thanks for sharing your experiences, my man. I&#039;d love to hear more about your bodybuilding days.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m all too familiar with this as a former competitive bodybuilder. You can&#039;t just go from &quot;off&quot; season to &quot;on&quot; season. It has to be a gradual shift in cleaning up your habits. Here&#039;s the thing about will power: we (at least I…) don&#039;t have that much of it. The little that I do have I usually spent getting out of bed in the morning. So anything that I really want to do, I have to commit to habit and encode into my routine gradually over time - to the point where the task literally becomes so natural that no energy is expended to perform it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/start-eating-healthy#comment-401&quot;&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;.

Great question, Michelle. 

First, I&#039;ll say that in many cases I will measure my progress, but I don&#039;t do it for everything. For example, I don&#039;t count calories.

For the things I do count, I usually keep a spreadsheet. As an example, right now I&#039;m working towards doing 100 pushups in a row. You can see all of my workouts are logged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApTNYzC_iYrtdGk5dGhydVJ4Zkt4cjY2MXg3T1VEOVE#gid=0&quot; title=&quot;pushup workouts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.

In many cases, I find that recording the task is part of the reward for me because it proves that I&#039;m making progress.

Hopefully that helps!]]></description>

Yep, very true. Trevor, you sound well-versed in intermittent fasting. For those looking for more info, however, you can find a full rundown here: https://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting]]></description>

I&#039;m glad to hear you made it through the sticking point and that you&#039;re doing well now. If you&#039;re up for sharing, I&#039;d love to know what tweaks you made along the way to make change easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Boy, I wish I had read this post about 5 years ago. Our diet is great now, but it took us forever to keep tweaking it until we were satisfied.  We were lucky to have each other cheering and strategizing all the way or we would never have stuck to any dietary changes for the better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good point about intermittent fasting. Few things will simplify a diet like good &#039;ol intermittent fasting. As you say, two meals per day is far simpler than the oft prescribed 5 to 7. 

And one meal per day even simpler yet.

Not to mention all the health benefits that can be realized from intermittent fasting.

For those looking to clean up their diet in the simplest fashion possible, intermittent fasting is a good place to begin.

Cheers!]]></description>
