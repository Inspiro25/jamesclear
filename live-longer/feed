					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful article James!! Thanks for bringing forward the concept of IKIGAI for everyone to contemplate. Unfortunately most of us are existing without any greater purpose, which brings void in life. As per ancient Vedic knowledge, the birth as Human being is rare and happens after millions of births in different species. Human life has specific purpose for transcending from the cycle of Birth and Death.

I would like to mention that one&#039;s IKIGAI should be something for spiritual benefit of self and other human beings. It should bringing perpetual joy to oneself, otherwise you will again feel the void after reaching your goal, as pointed out by you happened once you stopped playing basketball. 
 
Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James!

A great piece. I am greatly convinced without a purpose, a relativistic lifestyle sets in and can destroy a person. For me, my purpose starts with my faith. I am to be as God wants me to be, and do as He wants me to do. That may be a bit vague. But it allows me to listen and learn how I can use all that God has given me (good and bad) and apply it to my life for the betterment of others. I hope others may find their vocation early in life so they can start to live with purpose.

Take care!

Joe]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually teach clients how to reach their goals by having them schedule the action steps of the particular goal into their day planner, calendar or electronic calendar. So I totally agree with &quot;scheduling your practice&quot; idea for attaining goals and finding purpose in life. 

In my own life, exercise is really important to me and has been for the last 23 years. I still write in my day planner &quot;run&quot;, &quot;bike&quot;, &quot;yoga&quot;, or &quot;swim&quot; on certain days of the week just to make sure that I will do it. 

Thanks for the great post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,

It is true when they say: When you are ready the teacher will come. You are a great teacher and today&#039;s reading is directly to the point where I&#039;m trying to get unstuck. Thanks for directions. I was given hints but just couldn&#039;t read them. By now.

Thanks again and looking forward for the next read.

BR,
Tatjana]]></description>
