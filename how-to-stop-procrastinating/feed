					<description><![CDATA[James, I just wanted to take a minute to thank you for this. I have been struggling my entire life with hesitating to start tasks, and like you said, almost all the time we all have the ability to complete them well. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I have kicked myself for missed opportunities and work that is not up to my potential. This rule is beautifully simple yet excruciatingly effective. I just tried it on multiple daily chores and the resistance to perform them melted away. I even used it to decide to write this comment.

Thank you for the fantastic idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James- thanks to your eBook, I floss my teeth and run daily. As a police chief, writer, artist and blogger, I have a tight schedule. Your sensible tips and content are great. The two minute procrastination tip works- I left this comment in under a minute.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read about 70-80 articles today on how to stop procrastination!

Trust me. I&#039;m a procrastinator since 6 years and currently I&#039;m desperate to change this attitude. And this article is the most practical one and the best too.

So, &lt;em&gt;grazie&lt;/em&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Your article is really inspiring. Also the golden &quot;2-minute rule&quot; that you have explained really works.

I have applied it for my small goals until now and it really works. I have finished so many of my pending tasks.

Thanks! Great Article]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the headline of this article which began, &quot;How to stop procrastinating...&quot; and I thought, hey, I will read the piece later. 

Just kidding! I liked the article because it makes a lot of sense. It&#039;s a New Year and it&#039;s time to get cracking. I can spare two minutes for tasks I only seem to hate when I&#039;m not doing them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, SO brilliant! I know I should probably write more, but I just don&#039;t have more to say to this great post.

Thank you for the idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, great idea to draw a connection between making progress on goals and the general productivity concept of the 2-minute rule. 

I&#039;m about to head off and do some reading based on your suggestion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/how-to-stop-procrastinating#comment-1279&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

I used this rule when I wanted to get up at 5 am every morning to work on my business before my day job and could see how I was going to get there from my usual 7 am wake up time. It took me several months of waking up just a few minutes earlier each week but now I do it and I didn&#039;t even notice the difference from one week to the next. My mornings are so much more productive now and the importance of the change was worth the length of time it took in small increments so that it stuck. 

Thanks James!]]></description>
