					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/happy-driven#comment-6689&quot;&gt;Christian V&lt;/a&gt;.

Chritaian V, He does an amazing job. Sometimes we need to get the FISH(James Articles) go home and scale it, cook it and eat it (Take it in and see what comes out of it for our personal issues)

Honestly you answered and asked your own questions and concerns. So he didnt have to go into detail. You figured it out all on your own! no need for him to baby walk you, he clearly states its his opinion and hes not a rocket scientist and that hes still figuring it out.

IT CALLED the school OF LIFE.... AS time passes you WILL GET YOUR DETAILS that will be personalized JUST FOR YOU!

but thanks for your comment because it made me realize, the reason i just searched his name in my email just to re-read some articles over. AMAZING! It gets me to start thinking of my OWN DETAILS! ... gNITE]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this discussion and related argument is the essence of being &#039;called&#039; vs. driven.  

It probably demands a certain level of faith to believe in the notion, but I think it is a key to happiness.  Working, even toiling, in an area you feel uniquely fits you and your purpose in life drives satisfaction from the moment you begin...long before goals are accomplished, milestones achieved, etc.  

It truly connects you to the journey vs. a destination.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey James! Just wanted to say that your blog resonates with me a lot, and it helps me understand the complications of life a little better. Thank you so much for these wonderful reads. 
Also wanted to say that I totally agree that you have to fall in love with the routine, to achieve higher than your goals. But is that something you can teach yourself? Isn&#039;t that a pre-requisite before choosing a field, that you love doing something and get attracted to it naturally! And if you can, how do you do it? How do you motivate yourself other than the promise of future glory? I hope you can write an article elaborating on it too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post reminded me of Russ Harris and his book: &quot;The Happiness Trap: How to Stop Struggling and Start Living: A Guide to ACT&quot;

As the title says he is a supporter of ACT (Acceptance Commitment Therapy). A large part in his book discusses a value driven life/lifestyle. In that you don&#039;t have to achieve certain goals in your life, but try to live it according to your inner values. Because a simple goal can be accomplished, but you cannot reach a certain value you can only strive to live according to it. So in your example of Mr. Branson, his value could be to have an entrepreneur-lifestyle and bring constantly new ideas to success. In this case he could get up every morning and live to his value, whereas when he had only the goal of becoming a billionaire, he could have stopped after the first billion.

Hope this made sense to you. ;) 

Maybe you give this book a read, it gave me some really good suggestions. Greetings from Berlin.]]></description>
