					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/overcome-fear#comment-14185&quot;&gt;Fairbuying&lt;/a&gt;.

Fairbuying - I agree wholeheartedly that fear is exceedingly difficult to overcome.  I have spent 40 years in fear.  Fear of everything!  Small fears and large.  But I can tell you:  The way out of a fear-filled life is exactly the same for them as it is for us.  I say from experience that the advice above works.  It&#039;s the same advice you&#039;ll read in other columns, just better articulated - and James Clear&#039;s columns are in my opinion the best. 

So, Fairbuying, don&#039;t give up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this motivating article about that THING that torments us.  I guess,  in the back of our mind, we think &quot;How about if it doesn&#039;t happen the way we want?&quot; &quot;How about if nothing happens?&quot;  &quot;How about if I can&#039;t handle what might happen?&quot; &quot;How about if they don&#039;t like my work?&quot;

Well, how about if we stop thinking about those &quot;how abouts&quot; and take that roller coaster ride?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, I liked all the quotes but the one that resonated most was “start small” by Seth Godin. I’ve performed standup comedy and in the beginning even three minutes on stage was nerve wracking. But after a while, three minutes became easy but five minutes was scary. And then ten minutes or more.  For me it’s always a gradual process beginning with a safe level in terms of minutes on stage or size of an audience.  Then just beyond that level of safety are longer sets, new material or larger crowds.  Sort of a game between the feeling of “No problem, I’ve got this,” and “uh, oh I hope this works.” Kurt]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/overcome-fear#comment-14185&quot;&gt;Fairbuying&lt;/a&gt;.

Fairbuying, you lost the point. The famous people did not become famous because they were meant to be famous. They were common people too, who fought their fear and moved on to achieve their dream and fame was actually the by-product of their effort. You can become famous too, when you have a goal and break all barriers and keep doing it &#039;till you become it.

The most important part of the journey is to start. You will get there!  Fame will follow you when you keep high goals and work towards it.

Best of Luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Your job is to create.&quot; My new mantra this year, James. Thanks for underscoring it for me today.  It&#039;s my inner voice of wisdom speaking firmly but lovingly to my frenzied lizard brain that&#039;s constantly darting about, wasting my creativity and obliterating my peace. Oh, I love that inner voice of wisdom! Thanks for sharing so much of it with us today!]]></description>
