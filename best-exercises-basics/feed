					<description><![CDATA[I read the article and had a few good facts... but really wasn&#039;t that helpful.

I eat a banana or apple before going to the gym, my meal with protein after the gym and more fruits at my lunch break. 5 days a weeks, 30 min, 8 mph everyday and spend 2 hours each visit. Burn more than a 1000 calories daily. Lost 40 pounds in 2 months.

Why I&#039;m saying that is because this is all hard work and motivation with dedication to success. Want a perfect cut lean body so I&#039;m not stopping until it happens.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keeping healthy is the best thing you can do for yourself. Starting to execise for some people can be a bit confusing. So I&#039;m grateful that I was able to get to know about this 6 truths that some people don&#039;t want believe.            

The time is 5:00 a.m and I start now with my exercising! Iyooo! Nothing is going to stop me now, come whatever may but I&#039;m not going to lose focus on my long term goal (my health).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It;s very good. However, I do exercise everyday and I do have my chart to follow every day. So I do keep track of my workouts and as you had mentioned it clearly shows which I was doing badly...

Thanks a lot for this motivation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I like your honest, straight-forward advice. I would like to ask if perhaps you could comment on what a weeks training program for you is? 

I know I would be very interested (and I would suggest a lot of people feel the same). There is a lot of questionable programs and blogs out there, and I think everyone would really enjoy reading a practical example of the workout program you conduct. 

I understand that everyone is at different stages of health etc, but I am really curious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing I always tell people is that losing weight or wanting to be healthy should be looked at more as a lifestyle change. People typically find themselves in the physical condition their in because of the choices they&#039;ve made in their lives, so in order for them to see those positive changes they desire, they must be willing to make the appropriate changes in their lives. These changes are permanent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/best-exercises-basics#comment-3694&quot;&gt;Jacqui&lt;/a&gt;.

Jacqui, I&#039;m about to graduate with a bachelor of science in exercise physiology (I&#039;m currently completing my internship at an assisted living facility where I help people in their 80s and 90s exercise) and I have fibromyalgia. I understand where you are coming from. The American College of Sports Medicine has created a framework they refer to as FITT; it stands for Frequency, Intensity, Type, and Time. These four variables can be manipulated to create a workout specific to an individual and to provide the progressive overload needed to keep seeing gains. Frequency refers to how often you work out. For people in cardiac rehab, this can be as often as 6x a day, for a few minutes at time. Intensity refers to how strenuous your workout is. For most people, it should be moderate. Type is what kind of activity. Not everyone can run or lift weights, some people do much better swimming or doing yoga or tai chi or using a recumbent bike. Time is how long you do it for. If you tire easily, start small, with an exercise that is easy on your body and in a safe environment for you (since you said you have an immune deficiency). Try to work up to 30 minutes a day, even if you can only do a few minutes at a time (this is called the additive effect). Most importantly, even though it is sometimes hard, focus on what you CAN do, instead of the things your body won&#039;t do. It is important to love ourselves;it is much easier to take care of things we love than things we don&#039;t like.]]></description>
