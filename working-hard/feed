					<description><![CDATA[James K. Polk, our 11th President, said that he would accomplish everything he laid out at the outset of his presidency. True to his word, he achieved everything he set out to achieve, but it came with a great price. He literally had to work himself to death (he would survive the presidency for only 3 months, the shortest retirement of any ex-president). Granted, on many days he related on his diary entry that he &quot;much fatigued and exhausted by the incessant labors and great responsibilities of the past week&quot;. Nevertheless, he achieved the goals he promised to achieve. He&#039;s one of those presidents who should be rated at the &quot;near great&quot; category, alongside Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt...]]></description>

Eric -- first of all, welcome to the community. It&#039;s great to have you here and I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the interview. 

As for your work habits and stress, I think you touched on an important idea. Just because you did something once (like leaving your desk at lunch), doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re doing it often. Simple suggestions like the ones in this article can make a big impact if we do them consistently, but we often write them off because we think, &quot;Yeah, I did that and I&#039;m still stressed.&quot;

Good work on realizing that you need to get back in the routine. Feel free to stop back anytime and share your thoughts, ideas, and progress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heard you on the Fat-burning Man podcast as well and I really appreciated your desire to continue to learn more about healthy living. This is a great post, thank you for sharing. I&#039;ve chosen one of those &quot;high-education, high-stress, low-paying,&quot; jobs and have been dangerously close to burnout lately. There are some thing in here I used to do that I realized I have completely gotten away from. I exercise daily when I get home, but have stopped leaving my desk at lunch, taking breaks every 90 minutes, and my 2-mile lunchtime walk.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the article, CJ.

And thanks for sharing your experience. Isn&#039;t it crazy how it works like that? It takes courage to commit and put the things you believe in at the forefront of your life. But once you do, everything seems to fall into place.]]></description>

Tammy -- thanks for sharing your transformation! I&#039;m sure many of the superhumans in our community will find it useful.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/working-hard#comment-366&quot;&gt;Darius Belejevas&lt;/a&gt;.

I think that&#039;s something a lot of driven and success-oriented people deal with -- myself included. When working hard is part of who you are, it&#039;s easy to think that the answer is always to work harder.

Thanks for sharing, Darius!]]></description>

Keith -- I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the interview. I had a lot of fun doing it.

I love how you give your clients specific examples. I&#039;ve found the same thing: general advice may sound good, but specific directions get things done.

p.s. Welcome to the community! It&#039;s great to have you here. Feel free to share your ideas here anytime. I&#039;m sure our community will benefit from your thoughts and experiences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Found you via the Fat Burning Man podcast! Really enjoy your inspirational twitter quotes too. 

This was a timely post - it&#039;s something I discuss with my PT clients a lot. Me encouraging them to &#039;move more&#039; during the work day wasn&#039;t quite effective enough - they needed something more concrete, so we made it more specific. Whenever you go to the toilet, go to one on a different floor. Leave your desk at lunch, and walk a route you&#039;ve never walked before. Things like that.

And the when you&#039;re on holiday, be on holiday line.... I could not agree more! No one does that where I work. But, I do it. And guess what? Nothing bad happens! Other people just have to make the decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, great actionable advice,

I used to have this problem and when looking back what I find the most thought provoking is that I actually felt guilty to take breaks, rest. As if I&#039;m falling behind because someone else, somewhere else might be working.

I had this unhealthy image that &#039;successful lifestyle&#039; has to be overburdened and overstressed.]]></description>
