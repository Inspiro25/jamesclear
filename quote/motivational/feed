		<title>&#8220;Think about self-control less as the quality of a person and more as the quality of a place. There are some places and situations that lean toward lower self-control and others that lean toward higher self-control. Self-control is about your context as much as your character. Put yourself in good positions.&#8221;</title>

Give your best effort, but no matter how it works out, trust that life will be good for you. Focus on how the world is working with you, not against you.</p>



<p>Everything you are given is material for the next move. Everything.&#8221;</p>
