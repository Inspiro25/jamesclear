<p>You can&#8217;t learn all the lessons beforehand. You learn a lot about what you want in a marriage&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;getting married. You discover what type of career you enjoy&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing a lot of work. And so it goes in nearly every area of life. In many cases, what you wish you knew ahead of time can only be learned after the decision is made.</p>



<p>So there is nothing left but to pay attention to what you like, continue to iterate, and commit to making the most of each opportunity. There is no perfect decision. Good decisions are made right after the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>The key is to reach for an extremely high bar, but to be adaptable enough to reframe the failures, disappointments, and defeats into fuel for the next thing. Give your best effort, but no matter how it works out, trust that life will be good for you. Focus on how the world is working with you, not against you.</p>



<p>Everything you are given is material for the next move. Everything.&#8221;</p>
