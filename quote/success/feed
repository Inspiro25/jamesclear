<p>You can&#8217;t learn all the lessons beforehand. You learn a lot about what you want in a marriage&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;getting married. You discover what type of career you enjoy&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing a lot of work. And so it goes in nearly every area of life. In many cases, what you wish you knew ahead of time can only be learned after the decision is made.</p>



<p>So there is nothing left but to pay attention to what you like, continue to iterate, and commit to making the most of each opportunity. There is no perfect decision. Good decisions are made right after the fact.&#8221;</p>
