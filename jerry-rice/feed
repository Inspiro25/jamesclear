					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/jerry-rice#comment-8304&quot;&gt;Judith Hoch&lt;/a&gt;.

What this says to me is you prefer fame and glory over being a good parent.

If you stop looking at your issue of no time as being a woman only issue, you might see that anyone in that position has similar problems.

I have two kids to look after as well as my elderly parents. I have very little time to myself, which is not nice, but given I have chosen this path I may as well do it as best as I can. It means putting off my wants for another 5 to 7 years, which is also hard at times, and I will find it hard returning to the workforce to gain a high income.

So I decided that my life is not actually about income or even getting recognition at all.

I have my duties to do for now and I work around them where I can, when I can. When my time comes in years to come, I will do them for myself, measuring my success against what I want to achieve rather than stress about the unfairness of the world.

I am a male, similar situation to you, but my outlook to it, compared to yours, are worlds apart.

Accept your situation rather than be annoyed with it.

Do the best you can, when you can, and your time will arrive later... and when it does, just do what you can and only compare against yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article. His book seems to point in the right direction. The word talented and similar words are often used as an excuse. He&#039;s talented I could never do this. He was born that way we could not get the muscles he got. The fact is that the people who reach the things you dream of often invest more time than you do and therefore they are getting better. The following example explains it:&quot; Robert and Jule never played golf before so they decide train for one month and then they would compete. Robert is training 1 hour and Jule is training 3 hours a day. Jule rules the competition and all the spectator are talking about her phenomenal talent but nobody mentions her effort.&quot;]]></description>

Yes, I&#039;ve felt frequent frustration at not becoming all I could be, because I do nearly all of the childcare, as well as the care of an elderly parent. Typical female role, while working 55 hour weeks, in the middle of the night, weekends, to keep up.  It is not fair, indeed.

But I come to James Clears&#039; blog exactly BECAUSE I must find a way to efficiently be terrific at what I do with the woefully little time I have left to develop my life after caring for everyone else.  My takeaway with today&#039;s blog is this:  I don&#039;t have the &quot;strength&quot; of time to myself, or an old boy&#039;s network, or even always enough confidence in my gifts, like some cocky young males I&#039;ve trained. :-)

But I have some serious talents to offer, and my time and energy is best used to focus on those. Exactly because I have some challenges or disadvantages in other areas that I best not lose energy on from day to day.]]></description>

My wife recommended that I read your blog and I have not been disappointed.  You are clear, consise and don&#039;t take credit for others work.  I apprecieated  your insight and look forward to the next.  As a long-time weight lifter, I like the analogies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Put in a volume of work.&quot;
Consistency is the key to everything. This one is definitely the hardest part of building skills because not many people are consistent. One of the problem in maintaining consistency is the reliance on motivation or moments of inspiration.
Once we’ve set a goal or decided a habit to implement in our life, stick to it and avoid caring about your laziness and the likes, Mini-habits can help in maintaining consistency too.

&quot;Focus on the areas of greatest leverage for your skill.”
I’m still confused about this one. I’ve heard of various opinion for this topic but after reading this post, I guess I’ll stick to focusing on my strength.
&quot;Find ways to continually improve and move the needle forward rather than falling into routines and patterns once we develop adequate skill levels.”
Great point. Pushing beyond our plateau will induce discomfort. I’ve felt this all the time especially when I’m doing something that’s  beyond my level.
Embracing the discomfort, do it anyway, and reflection and evaluation, can help to improve skills rapidly.
Thanks for the post, James. I don’t know who Jerry Rice is, but I can see that he’s someone that can be an inspiration for all of us who want to improve our life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James -- great article. The best in their fields are the ones who motor. They bring an uncommon effort and refuse to settle.

On another note... when asked by other players why he ran to the end zone after every catch in practice, Jerry Rice replied &quot;I&#039;m just building the habit.&quot;

MOTOR hard!]]></description>
