					<description><![CDATA[Love your 3 simple steps idea James. Because of the simplicity there is no reason why it shouldn&#039;t work for everyone. I have used your push-up idea and can guarantee it works. Can knock out 40 odd now. Last year I did something similar with pull-ups. I could never do more than a couple so I started doing 10 sets of 1 pull-up. Then 10 sets of 2 pull-ups, then 10 sets of 3 and so on slowly building all the time. When I got to 10 sets of 5 I was able to then do 10 pull-ups straight off. It took about 4 to 5 months to build up to being able to do a dozen which for a 67 year old I thought was ok. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James, 

Just one small question concerning the pushups.

So far I&#039;ve been trying to do the sets of 20 one after another but I must say that the third set - where I&#039;m right now - is nearly impossible to complete, when I take 1 minute breaks between the sets. 

So now I&#039;m spreading the sets of 20 (going for my fourth, one pushup after another, day by day) over the whole day but that feels a little bit to easy.

What would you advise? Concentrate it and push (literally) a little bit harder or spread the sets of 20 over the day, as long as I keep adding 1 per day?

Thanks for your great work, my colleagues and I love reading your blog twice per week.

Greetings from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

Your work actually introduced me to BJ Fogg&#039;s revolutionary idea of small habits. I tried it, and 2 really stuck with me. 1 is waking up earlier and 2 is making my bed! They both set the stage for how my day is going to go. I feel like I get to control what happens. Your articles are always insightful! Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, this has been a great plan for me.  I started at 10 pushups - though I knew I could do a lot more - and I decided that I was going to really concentrate on my form.  I decided that I would do hand-release pushups throughout this time, and make sure that my form would be perfect; straight back, elbows in (they flare out when I get tired), shoulder blades back.

Eventually, I broke things into two sets, and then three, since I felt that my form could be compromised if I did longer sets.  I only give myself 20 seconds of rest to make sure that I keep up the intensity of the work, while making sure my form stays good.  

Two things.  First, today was 26 pushups and I love the plan.  Second, I love it even more since I have recruited my son - having a loved one to share in a goal like this makes it more meaningful, more rewarding, and more fun.

Keep up the great work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Thanks for your tip and for laying it down in words.

In fact I began skipping rope for now one month and each day I add a little bit more. At the beginning my heart was pounding really fast in just 10 rope skipping. Now I can do 20, 20, 20 and feel at ease.

I began doing that after a hard working day. It was winter time and it was one thing I could do inside and quickly wearing me out.

Now it&#039;s an everyday need &#038; pleasure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great insight, James!  I love your posts and I love your continuous focus on the basics and habits.  It&#039;s really helping me see how to build a foundation for continuous improvement and development.

I&#039;m also using this same idea of starting small in my goal to learn how to play the piano.  I&#039;ve committed to only practicing 20 minutes per day.  That&#039;s a goal that I feel is manageable (I can afford to spend 20 minutes on almost anything).  And I&#039;m just going to stick to that amount.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome article James!

This is definitely some powerful advice! This in my mind is the true &quot;Secret&quot; to achieving our dreams. I started StongLifts 5x5 Jan 16 this year. Every mon, wed and fri i&#039;ve been adding 2.5kg to each exercise. I started with a 20kg squat and dead-lift and tmrw morning i&#039;m excited to finally squat 100kg with proper form, and dead lift 115kg. All in under 3 months. For the first month the weights were so easy i was tempted to just go straight to lifting heavy but i wanted to build the habit while things were easy. Definitely glad i did because now i&#039;m addicted to seeing the improvements each session.

Keep up the great content man, your building a killer community right here.]]></description>
