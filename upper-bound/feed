					<description><![CDATA[I realize this was the problem with trying to finish my doctorate directly after frontal lobe bypass surgery. I asked for additional time for me to continue knitting my brain, and my request was denied and needless to say, it blew up in my face. 

Glad to have read this great article and an interesting twist on goal setting. Thanks as usual!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,

Your way to sustain good habits really impressed me. I will use this for my IT Exam Preparation. Instead of studying 2 hours 5 day a week, I will make it 1 hour then I can increase when I sustain this routine habit.

Thanks for helping.

					<description><![CDATA[This makes me think of Subway. As a company, they were so focused on acquiring new franchisees and growing the number of stores, all else seemed to be secondary (or lower). As a result, they ended up with lawsuits, complaints, quality concerns, and a barrage of problems stemming from having no temperance to their growth obsession.]]></description>
