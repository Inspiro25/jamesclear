					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mr. James Clear,

          First of all, Thanks for putting your efforts in writing the stuff which helps lot of people. You can count me in that crowd.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/goals-systems&quot; title=&quot;goals and systems&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Forget About Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best article I ever read. I was stunned after reading that article. I realized how I was running towards the goal instead of enjoying the small step I make everyday. 

How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the “2–Minute Rule” is impressive as well. 

Cheers,
Navanee]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the article; right on the money. Too often people want and are promised instant results. 

There&#039;s an old saying, &quot;Something for nothing is worth it.&quot; (i.e. Worth nothing.)

Loved the quote at the start about the gym “You should do something easy today.” ... then compared slow &quot;easy&quot; gains. Took me years to understand this that a little effort ( right kind of effort) over a longer time is far more effective and sure than a massive amount over a short period ( massive action is something else and not to be confused!)

A lot of research supports this (Gladwell&#039;s 10,000 hours of deliberate practice = expertise) 

So what&#039;s the problem with that approach? Its not &quot;easy.&quot; It takes (a little) effort on a regular basis. But then the magic kicks in and it becomes a habit.

Anyway, great article that made me think. Thanks for that. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff!!

The idea of thinking in terms of incremental long term steady progress is really the thing that has worked for anyone who has had any decent level of success. The people that look like overnight successes rarely are.

The only thing I would add to your suggestion in regard to lifting is that the rate of increase actually can start higher. Most people can easily add 5-15 pounds (depending on the lift) each workout in the beginning because their body is improving so rapidly, but the longer you train (and the heavier your lifts) the less frequent and the smaller the increases will be.

In my opinion it is a waste to not aim for higher, but reasonable increases in the beginning (once good form is established). The hard part, for most people, seems to be being willing to scale back the increases as necessary.

I would strongly suggest this: http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=209&#038;rn=506&#038;action=show_detail for a great explanation of the process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You got that right. It&#039;s just that doing things the good way is too damn frustrating for a lot of people. You know that quality-proof dense muscle is built over time and it requires efforts regarding nutrition, recovery, and training. 

Most of the people are not able to do it consistently. That&#039;s why very few achieve great results!

Thanks for the heads up James. Slow, Slow, Slow, never stop!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, I like your take on goals. 

Just last week I had the same kind of epiphany when I went for my run. I realized that I&#039;m actually running about a marathon a week. Go figure??? 

For some reason I just never looked at it that way. When I was building my sale business I used to tell my team that the system never fails it&#039;s just that people fail to work the system. If you want to achieve your goal you need processes in place to help you get there. 

Good stuff and a great way to begin 2014 looking at the daily habits we have in place to keep living the life we love to live. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. 

Best Regards,
Dominic]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/slow-gains#comment-7313&quot;&gt;Scott Worthington&lt;/a&gt;.

I thought the same thing about its use in other aspects of life -- specifically wealth-building. 

I&#039;ve been thinking a lot about my retirement savings lately -- which feels weird considering I&#039;m only 25. I already a significant amount saved in my 401K and Roth IRA and that&#039;s not counting the fact that my company still has a pension plan! Basically, if you want to retire comfortable, you&#039;ve got to be consistent with your saving! Try to invest too much and you might get discouraged. 

If you invest too late, you&#039;ll have no choice but to invest a lot (hard, hard) but it could be too late anyway (hurt).]]></description>
