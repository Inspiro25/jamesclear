					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I live in the Coromandels, New Zealand, a truly beautiful and isolated place. A friend in Australia recently sent me your link for me to follow, and to encourage me on my life choices and this next adventure in my life. I am in my 40&#039;s and am about to start a full time degree in naturopathy, (which I will attach to my old Diploma of Sports Science, and make something of myself...) which means leaving my home town, loved ones, and the security of all that I know. Basically up heaving my life.

I have very little income, and am unsure how I&#039;m going to achieve the study, and getting an income, even enough to pay for my fuel to get to school each week, I seem to need all the encouragement I can get right now, and from reading your posts every week, to us out here, I have become more confident about my decision, and am looking forward to this new adventure and what it may bring to my life, and those around me.

Thank you James, I look forward to every post you post!

Lisa E.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the post, with great message for us all to know the importance to take responsibility of decisions in life no matter what our situation is. I never would&#039;ve thought about J.K. Rowling gone through that much to get to where she&#039;s now.

Always I find great things that can teach us some important things whenever I read about a successful person. Myself, I failed taking responsibility of my own decisions several times past few years, which caused me huge troubles and stress, lost money I didn&#039;t really have, and ruined my credit and record. I&#039;m just 24 and did all this stupid things mostly since I was 18 which put a burden on my shoulder and trying to figure out how to get out of my situation. I realized my mistakes before but still end up doing them again. I want to learn about internet marketing and do that even though I have no connections, inexperienced, and broke!

Anyways, there is always ways to learn and make the right decisions and no matter what state your in, there is always a solution to make it better. Better to be optimistic and take action to make a positive in life.]]></description>

I think, moving towards what makes you happy irrespective of the obstacles is what this article said. And for you, that&#039;s taking care of your kids. Whatever wants to stand on your path of doing that, then you have to fight it, ward it off and move towards doing your best with whatever circumstances or hand life plays you.

It would never be your fault, but it will be your responsibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, great story. JK Rowling is an inspiration in so many ways and a great example of someone who chose herself. Thanks for the hat tip.
