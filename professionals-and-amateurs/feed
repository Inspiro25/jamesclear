					<description><![CDATA[Thank you James. I&#039;m sharing this with my team today at SolarCity. Selling often involves a lot of rejection and boredom interspersed with great moments of elation and connection. Sometimes I get discouraged, especially by the boredom. After reading your piece I realized that you have to practice if you want to play the game! I will be thinking today about Kobe making his 800 free throws as I&#039;m out pitching in the field. Best to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, I have to say.

It is really that simple when you know where you are going. I often find myself to get lost in too many things and is hard to focus on one thing because I want everything at the same time. But I am working on that.

Thanks for the article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to start by saying that every single time I see an email from you in my email box, I jump for joy (maybe not literally, but the sentiment is there). I love your posts, your writing style and the way you motivate me. So, thanks!

Secondly, I have a couple areas I&#039;d like to improve in, one being a more consistent writing schedule, another being exercising more consistently. Those are the two big ones, but what might help even more is learning how to manage my time better. I take on too much and feel overwhelmed, but yet still try to do it all somehow. It is a constant struggle! 

Seriously, great post! I&#039;m off to share it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, James.

Wonderful read like always. Looking forward to starting squats and skipping rope and progress later for general fitness. This is an addition to working on my writing. 5 sentences a day I suppose is a nice place to start. :)

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your articles are mind blowing to me! I have always admired people that can put things in such excellent words. You have unclouded the core of my problems! Anyway, I am 21 years old and attending my second year of college. In high school I thought there was no way I would be able to attend college, there was always a little voice telling me, &quot; I am not smart enough.&quot;  Now I am attending a community college and doing a lot better than I ever thought I would. My dream would be to move onto a University and finish my undergrad in Biology and hopefully try  to get into PA school to become a Physician Assistant. You have given me my golden ticket  and helped me realize that I can be whatever I want! It&#039;s not about how smart I am at all.. It&#039;s about my mental toughness. 

  Thank you so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;You&#039;ll Never Regret Starting Important Work&quot; is a sentence dripping with so much fundamental truthiness that my mind has had it on loop since the moment I first read it.

Indeed. Phone down. To work.

All the best for 2015.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have taught elementary school for sixteen years and contrary to what some might think it is a very difficult profession. Because I am a generalist and teach math, writing, reading, science, social studies, computers, art and sometimes physical education. It&#039;s a constant task to stay current and sharp. 

I appreciate this post and the line that being a pro can be painful. Much has to be sacrificed in order to be excellent.

Keep up the great work, James!]]></description>
