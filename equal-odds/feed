					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/equal-odds#comment-11854&quot;&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt;.

Greg,

I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d call Gauss a counterexample. Gauss had volumes of -unpublished- work (of probably varying quality -- I tentatively add this as I am in no intellectual position to judge his work, only to use bits and pieces of it). One such gem was a mathematical technique analogous to the Fast Fourier Transform which, in fact, Gauss had probably come up with prior to Fourier publishing his foundational work on harmonic analysis (let alone being roughly a century before computationally efficient approaches for harmonic analysis were examined with gusto)! [1]

To me, an interesting tangent to James&#039; post are people like Gauss who had some idea which of their works would be most useful and focusing on putting them into the public sphere (Gauss&#039;s motto was &quot;pauca sed matura&quot; or &quot;few, but ripe&quot;).  That&#039;s not to say he was perfect in his prescience: note the missed harmonic analysis opportunity above.

					<description><![CDATA[Alright! Alright! I get it! I need to WRITE MORE! Ha Ha!

Seriously, almost every article or podcast I&#039;ve read/listened to over the last week has told me that in order to be successful at writing, I need to WRITE MORE. 

I&#039;m not saying this topic is overwritten, I&#039;m saying this is a sign that I need to stop making excuses, stop procrastinating and get my a** to work. 

Thanks for another reminder!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great piece for moving into the New Year, James. I love it!

Reminds me of a friend who always seemed to take great photos, back before digital. He finally told me his secret was &quot;take a lot of photos and throw most of them away. Just keep the good ones.&quot; Not being so attached that we cannot toss out sentences, paragraphs and whole pieces of writing is key. You just helped me set a new focus for my writing in 2015.

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Erdos was one of the great 20th century scientists who came from Hungary. Thanks for this post!

I&#039;ve made a small research on Nobel laureates, and your statement is supported by data of Harriet Zukerman: &quot;Nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than a matched sample of scientists [...] these patterns hold at every stage of the life-work-cycle.&quot; [1]

It&#039;s interesting to note that even Nobel laureates pale compared to some of the greatest scientists in history, for example Henri Poincaré or Leonhard Euler, both of whom Erdos has surpassed by number of publications. If numbers really matter, then Erdos will be remembered as probably the most influental mathematicians ever.

But there are notable counterexamples. For example, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Isaac Newton published few papers, and their influence still has have been most profound.
