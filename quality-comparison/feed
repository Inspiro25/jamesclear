					<description><![CDATA[I must say this article really isn&#039;t as good as some of your other ones... I&#039;m only joking. Haha!

In all honesty, this is one of the most insightful articles I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of fishing out of the overwhelming sea of mediocrity known as the Internet.

You do great things, James.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your content/presentation is as far as I can tell near perfect, that&#039;s why I can&#039;t put my finger on it why it just doesn&#039;t come alive and do that little parenthetical dance.  It could be just that your writing is not anointed by the Almighty.  I am still here, and look forward to your treatises.  Happy New Year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As new years approaches and we all look to set our selves new goals and challenges (or habits) I find it important to understand why we are setting these and where we want them to take us and I think this article is great at reminding us that those should reflect on our own capabilities and needs and fit our own standards.

Not judging yourself in relation to others is perhaps one of the most difficult things to do. But this article is a great reminder as to why we should really look at getting over that mental block and just trying to be the best that we are.

Thank you James.]]></description>
