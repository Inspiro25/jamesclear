					<description><![CDATA[One of my friends travels a lot and always packs a jump-rope in his suitcase. If you&#039;re not used to it, jumping rope can be difficult to sustain for more than a few minutes. However, with practice you can get a good workout... my friend jumps rope for 30-60 minutes at a time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked your expression: &quot;to capture the essence of a place&quot;... it is so inspiring. Thank you. 

And also, although I like travelling, it usually confuses my life and systems when I return to my normal routines. But I will try your tips (a bit of modifying -- like in ten days one day off and travel in the city with my camera like a flaneur.) :) 

Thanks James.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[8 weeks on, 1 week off... sounds like an interesting strategy.

My body gets tired when I work out for 10-12 weeks in a row (feel some craps and fatigue). I end up having a massage to have the muscles loosened and take rest that week.

Thanks for the tip... it&#039;s something I&#039;ll try out...]]></description>

I also bought a TRX to use at home, but it is great for being able to get a pulling movement in with push ups and squats if there is no place for pull ups.]]></description>
