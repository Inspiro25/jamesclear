					<description><![CDATA[So James, I am brand new to this community of like minded people. So far, I love it. But I was thinking about what defines a community and of course, a large part of that is the interaction between members, be it a family, at work, or here. But I&#039;ve noticed that the commentors all comment or respond to your blog&#039;s only. There does not seem to be a lot of interaction between the commentators. I wonder how we could get dialogue going between members on any given blog topic? There have been a few comments from people that I would like to have responded to but by the time I reply, their comment was quite a few comments back so my comment or reply would make no sense. Oh I am also very impressed and how you reply to almost every comment posted. Very cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James - it is wonderful to be part of such a supportive, positive community! I believe that those who are on a similar path and seeking similar things are drawn together - and as a result your keystone community becomes a &#039;collective consciousness&#039; in a way - you can throw out a question or plea to this community and there will always be someone there with an answer. Like attracts like :) I have been through a really hard time over the last few years and now finally feel like life is opening up again in new and inspiring ways. Blogs and communities like this are a big part of that - thank you!]]></description>

Mack -- first, thanks for reading. And more importantly, welcome to our community! I couldn&#039;t be happier to have you here and I think you&#039;ll find a wide range of supportive people who care about the same things you care about. It&#039;s awesome to have you join our ranks.

In the meantime, I&#039;ll do my best to keep the good stuff coming your way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have re-read this particular post several times because it struck me in a good way, and I didn&#039;t want to comment without some reflection. Over the years, I have read a ton of material on self-improvement, much of some value, a small percentage either not applicable or potentially harmful. Your idea that it is the process that results in growth, not the endpoint is very refreshing, liberating, even. This I will take to heart, and I look forward to being a part of this community. Thanks again!]]></description>

&quot;People are so awesome.&quot; I couldn&#039;t agree more.

Your habit challenge is awesome, too. It&#039;s going to be fun to follow your progress. Make sure you stop back and let us know how your habits are going (and if we can help in any way).

Thanks for being part of our community, Mary Kathryn!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more!  I am working on cultivating 12 new habits, starting one each month and piling habit upon habit.  I started a blog more of less to track my progress and keep me accountable to something other than myself.  And so far that&#039;s been working.  

But what I&#039;ve also discovered through this blog, is a really wonderful, inspiring and motivating community of like&#8211;minded individuals.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/you-are-not-alone#comment-205&quot;&gt;Tanya&lt;/a&gt;.

Tanya -- congrats on living healthy and getting your family to join in. That&#039;s great news for all of you. (Related note: I&#039;d love to visit New Zealand in the near future. As a travel photographer, it&#039;s like a gold mine.)

And, of course, I&#039;m glad you&#039;re enjoying our blog and community here. I&#039;m looking forward to connecting more. Feel free to leave a comment anytime. :)]]></description>

I couldn&#039;t agree more. Anything significant is always achieved as a team ... if for no other reason than simply that humans are meant to share connection. I&#039;m happy to have you here, Darius. Thanks for commenting so often. It&#039;s always nice to see you contribute.]]></description>

Thanks Joel! I just moved myself about six months ago, so I totally get it. Hopefully you can find a small sense of community here. I&#039;m looking forward to connecting with you more.

Thanks for reading!]]></description>
