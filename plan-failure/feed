					<description><![CDATA[I have had success with your insight into identity habits and how habits in general work. There have been many occasions where I have failed to start a habit or continue a habit, which made me feel *gasp* like a failure. Now I can stop beating myself up over failure because I now know that it is not about perfection, but it is all about showing up and to plan for the days I do not show up so that I can rebound from setbacks to continue showing up.

Thank you James! You have helped me so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this post - I really needed a plan to overcome the thought of having to do everything perfectly.  For those who are perfectionists, the thought of having to do every little detail absolutely correctly is a daunting task.  The story of the nutritionist looking at calorie at the end of the week (&quot;average speed&quot;) it so helpful in visualizing this approach in action.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I needed to read this today. I am working on building habits in a few areas of my life (fitness, diet, and writing). I so often view a miss or slip as failure. But everyday/week I keep working towards the ultimate goal is a success, it&#039;s all progress. What a life-changing idea! Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. 

I personally have always had to struggle with the idea of allowing oneself to fail. Yes, it all gets down to developing and ensuring longevity of a habit. How long does that habit take to become entrenched. Some say 20 days and others 39. I would argue 100 days.

By nature we are not perfect, and so many life gurus and society in general has encourage us to cheat. Live on this starvation diet for 6 days and then cheat on the seventh day. There is some scientific sense to do this from a dieting perspective, but it seems that we use the cheat concept for everything - in our relationships, in our health, in our careers, and etc. We live our lives just like our society has evolved in that we have evolved into a nation of cheaters. Always looking for the easy route.

I would thus make a big distinction between failure and cheating. If you are going to fail, fail falling hard and not by taking an easy route. It is only an excuse.

Alcoholics anonymous advocates zero tolerance for failure, because they know a cheat drink here and there would not work curing the addiction. I tested this out by doing a GONG where 100 days I would not eat bread (my favorite food), not drink any alcohol or caffeine and run up a mountain every day. With a GONG, when you fail you have to start back from the beginning. So you go 98 days and fail, you have to go back to day 1. This is so powerful, but it works. Failure is a NO NO. Best habit builder ever. You don&#039;t want to fail and so you push yourself.  It is like being in the marine corps. 

I have not tried a GONG for writing yet, as I feel that it will be a very difficult task. I will let you know when I do and how often I failed.

James -- good thing you opened the comments again. :)]]></description>
