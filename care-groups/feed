Hi Sonam
I’m not too sure if I can help directly but I can give you some pointers that may help. If you were my child I would say, “Go to university and learn to become a medical practitioner. By doing that, you will learn how to analyse problems and situations, how to apply solutions, how to write reports clearly and unambiguously, how to speak clearly and become well educated. Once you have the qualifications, the education is in your head and no-one can take it away from you. Then you can look around and see what interests YOU, what you can be passionate about, how you can apply what you have learnt (it may not be directly related to medical practice) and make it a lifetime interest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/care-groups#comment-9405&quot;&gt;Sonam&lt;/a&gt;.

Sonam,

You are clearly equipped with all the tools you need for a successful life. You are facing a couple of challenges.

 1. Developing the ability to discover and define what success means for you. This isn&#039;t a once and done activity. Dig deep, read widely and dream. This definition will change as you live and grow. Define success for you as a whole person.

2. Recognize that there is no one magic career path answer. Here I suggest reading &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;.  Right now it probably feels like you have to make all the &quot;right&quot; decisions or the rest of your life will be irrevocably screwed. I know I felt that pressure. It&#039;s much simpler than that. Show up, don&#039;t do heroin or have a baby before you are 30 and you are going to do just fine.

3. Your parents love you and want the best for you. In the long term, the best for you means using your talents and gifts in a way that is deeply satisfying. You may have to let them be disappointed in the short term in order to accomplish this. If you are clear about what you want and are clear with them about this, then you will be the most successful you they could dream of and you will all be that much closer. Taking on this responsibility for your happiness and the success of your relationship with your parents is scary and a necessary part of growing up. 

You are engaging in all the right struggles and will reap the reward.

All the best,

Danielle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really liked that article. I think I need some new people surrounding me. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll find 107,000. 

I&#039;ll start slow. :)

I do think this has an impact on daily life. I think also that your circle of friends, coworkers, etc... all play a part in your overall outlook.]]></description>

I don&#039;t have any answer, but I deeply relate. I belonged to Alcoholics Anonymous many years ago. I was 24 and there were so many people my age getting sober. I made the deepest connections I ever made and had the most fun I ever had. Time moved on, things changed, and (like you) I&#039;ve searched or tried to create something similar (minus the alcohol addiction part) ever since. I&#039;m still at it. I think it has a lot to do with becoming clearer and clearer, and being able to articulate that so that we attract people looking for what it is we&#039;re wanting to create. Good luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, I&#039;m new to your blog and to your work. I&#039;m impressed so far! You&#039;re a very good writer, in addition to being an insightful individual. If these first few posts I&#039;ve read are any indication of the future (and I think they are), I feel like I&#039;ve discovered a treasure. Thank you! Well done. Keep it up!]]></description>
