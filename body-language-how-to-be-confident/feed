					<description><![CDATA[James,

Can you explain how you got the percentage change in testosterone and cortisol? I did not see a baseline in the original paper and can replicate it using average human hormone levels.]]></description>

Abdul,

I think you&#039;ll continue to see benefits from doing the pose multiple times per day (whenever you need a boost of confidence), but there is obviously a limit. It is not as if testosterone continues to climb unrestricted. 

Good luck!
James]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I have this question: What happens to my testosterone and cortisol levels if I assume Wonder Woman power pose for more than 2 minutes or if I do it several times a day? 

For example, going through power pose several times due to several social or business encounter in one day.

Thanx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently fractured my spine and have been hauled up in a brace which I am now weaning from. In my first few weeks I was more active (travel without a back pack), felt a lot better. In my next set of weeks I found myself in more passive positions, I was more negative. This seems to tie in with your presentation.]]></description>

Great points, Josh. I&#039;m a big fan of balance, so I&#039;m glad you brought this into the discussion. I&#039;ll have to do some more writing and research on that.

Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am generally confident, and I know I stand in power poses
much of the time. I am curious about a few things: 1. The first and
second poses in the top row of power poses usually &quot;irk&quot; me when I
first encounter someone in that pose. They seem fake, as if someone
is trying to communicate their power although they deep down don&#039;t
actually have any. 2. When I am actively listening to someone,
especially if my response requires a lot of empathy, openness, and
compassion for whatever the person is talking about, I find myself,
many times, in a pose quite similar to the first one on the bottom
row. I don&#039;t consciously do it; I just realize I am standing like
that. I feel like it is disarming me so that others can feel that
they can speak freely to someone who doesn&#039;t see themselves as
&quot;higher&quot; than they are. I find that, generally speaking, people are
quite open with me, and many times I am standing in a pose like
that. (Perhaps without my arms crossed though?) Would either of
those thoughts jive with the research? What do you all think about
both points? I&#039;m seeking to understand what it my reactions mean.
