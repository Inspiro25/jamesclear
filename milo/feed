					<description><![CDATA[When you have a Habit  that is IMPORTANT to you, you then LOVE working on it, you feel at peace because you know what to do and not worry on how to be happy or what to do to be happy, and because it is IMPORTANT to you and you LOVE it, you work on it whether you are feeling good or feeling bad, the Habit become more important than how you feel.
It lifts you above feelings of good and bad this is a state of peace.
You make a habit important by spending time working on it regularly and consistently, that&#039;s how you fall in love with it.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

This does work. I used a 66 day habit calendar I got from The 1 Thing book and used it for swimming and pushups/chinups to slowly build up laps and reps. 

Just a question what if you did miss a day or two? Should I start all over again?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

I&#039;ve really enjoyed reading your blog.  I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off for over a year and found the trick to keeping it off was developing good diet and exercise habits.  I was delighted to find your blog earlier this year because you&#039;ve referenced and simplified a lot of the things that I&#039;ve read that helped me make these changes.  I especially loved your article about failure being a science experiment.  I have some health issues that make some exercises challenging for me and that article came on a day where I was feeling frustrated.  It helped change my mindset and I was able to overcome some of those challenges.   

Anyhow, just wanted to say thanks for all you do and  I&#039;m looking forward to the workshop!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow this &quot;Milo of Croton&quot; is an interesting dude -- never heard of him, but the lessons from his life are very relevant, not only in strength training but in every other thing or project we&#039;re undertaking, we&#039;ve got to be patient with ourselves and our progress. Like Kestrel just said &quot;Rome wasn&#039;t built in a day&quot;.

Great post James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post James. 

Having recently resumed weight lifting it&#039;s great to read some clear, actionable advice. 

As they say, &quot;Rome wasn&#039;t built in a day.&quot;]]></description>
