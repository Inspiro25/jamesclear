										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your environment has an incredible ability to shape your behavior.</p>
<p>I have written previously about <a title="choice architecture" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/choice-architecture">choice architecture</a> and <a title="environment design" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/environment-design-organ-donation">environment design</a>, both of which are focused on the idea that, &#8220;By making small changes to the physical environment around you, it can become much easier to stick to good habits.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the research studies I have shared in those articles are interesting, I thought it might be useful to list some practical ways to apply environment design to your world and make it easier to live a healthy, happy, and adventurous life.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are 10 simple strategies for designing your environment to <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/eat-healthy">eat healthy</a> without thinking and spend more of your time and energy on doing something awesome.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these ideas are just a start. You can apply these concepts for designing your environment and creating better &#8220;choice architecture&#8221; to almost any habit or behavior.</p>
<p><span id="more-5486"></span></p>
<h2>How to Eat Healthy Without Thinking</h2>
<p>Before we begin, let&#8217;s give credit to the researcher behind many of these ideas. Brian Wansink is a professor at Cornell University and he has completed a variety of studies on how your environment shapes your eating decisions. Many of the ideas below come from his popular book, <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/mindless-eating">Mindless Eating</a> (<a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/audiobook/mindless-eating">audiobook</a>).</p>
<p><strong>1. Use smaller plates.</strong> Bigger plates mean bigger portions. And that means you eat more. According to a study conducted by Wansink and his research team, if you made a simple change and served your dinner on 10-inch plates instead of a 12-inch plate, you would eat 22% less food over the course of the next year.</p>
<p>On a related note, if you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;I&#8217;ll just put less food on my plate&#8221; &#8230; it&#8217;s not that simple. The picture below explains why. When you eat a small portion off of a large plate, your mind feels unsatisfied. Meanwhile, the same portion will feel more filling when eaten off of a small plate. The circles in the image below are the same size, but your brain (and stomach) doesn&#8217;t view them that way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5488" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5488" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-5488 size-full" src="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/delboeuf-illusion-eating.jpg" alt="This image shows how small portion sizes can look filling on a small plate, but sparse on a large plate. This strategy is a good way to eat healthy without thinking. " width="700" height="353" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5488" class="wp-caption-text">This image shows how small portion sizes can look filling on a small plate, but sparse on a large plate.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>2. Make water more readily available.</strong> Most of us mindlessly take a swig of soda or a sip of coffee as we do other tasks. Try this instead: buy a large bottle water and set it somewhere close to you throughout your day. You’ll find that if it’s sitting next to you, you’ll often opt for water instead and avoid less healthy drink options naturally.</p>
<p>Note: I love <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/link/vapur-water-bottle">this Vapur water bottle</a> because it holds a good amount of water and folds up small enough to fit in a backpack, purse, or pocket. It’s perfect for travel too.</p>
<p><strong>3. Want to drink less alcohol or soda? Use tall, slender glasses instead of short, fat ones.</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at the image below. Is the horizontal or vertical line longer?</p>
<figure id="attachment_5489" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5489" style="width: 990px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-5489 size-full" src="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vertical-drink-illusion.jpg" alt="Like the lines in this photo, vertical glasses will look bigger horizontal ones and will therefore naturally help you drink less. This strategy is a good way to eat healthy without thinking. " width="990" height="500" srcset="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vertical-drink-illusion.jpg 990w, https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vertical-drink-illusion-768x388.jpg 768w, https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vertical-drink-illusion-300x151.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5489" class="wp-caption-text">Like the lines in this photo, vertical glasses will look bigger than horizontal ones and will therefore naturally help you drink less.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As it turns out, both lines are the same length, but our brain has a tendency to overestimate vertical lines. In other words, taller drinks look bigger to our eyes than round, horizontal mugs do. And because height makes things look bigger than width, you&#8217;ll actually drink less from taller glasses. In fact, you will typically drink about 20% less from a tall, slender glass than you would from a short, fat glass. (Hat tip to <a title="summer tomato" href="http://summertomato.com/how-toeat-less-without-noticing/">Darya Pino</a> for originally sharing this image and idea.)</p>
<p><strong>4. Use plates that have a high contrast color with your food.</strong> As I mentioned in <a title="easy ways to lose weight" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/feeling-fat">this article</a>, when the color of your plate matches the color of your food, you naturally serve yourself more because your brain has trouble distinguishing the portion size from the plate. Because of this, dark green and dark blue make great plate colors because they contrast with light foods like pasta and potatoes (which means you’re likely to serve less of them), but don’t contrast very much with leafy greens and vegetables (which means you’re likely to put more of them on your plate).</p>
<p><strong>5. Display healthy foods in a prominent place.</strong> For example, you could place a bowl of fruits or nuts near the front door or somewhere else that you pass by before you leave the house. When you’re hungry and in a rush, you are more likely to grab the first thing you see.</p>
<p><strong>6. Wrap unhealthy foods in tin foil. Wrap healthy foods in plastic wrap.</strong> The old saying, “out of sight, out of mind” turns out to have some truth to it. Eating isn’t just a physical event, but also an emotional one. Your mind often determines what it wants to eat based on what your eyes see. Thus, if you hide unhealthy foods by wrapping them up or tucking them away in less prominent places, then you are less likely to eat them.</p>
<p><strong>7. Keep healthy foods in larger packages and containers, and unhealthy foods in smaller ones.</strong> Big boxes and containers tend to catch your eye more, take up space in your kitchen and pantry, and otherwise get in your way. As a result, you’re more likely to notice them and eat them. Meanwhile, smaller items can hide in your kitchen for months. (Just take a look at what you have lying around right now. It’s probably small cans and containers.)</p>
<p>Bonus tip: if you buy a large box of something unhealthy, you can re-package it into smaller Ziploc bags or containers, which should make it less likely that you’ll binge and eat a lot at once.</p>
<p><strong>8. Serve meals by using the “half plate” rule.</strong> You can design your eating environment as well. When you serve yourself dinner, start by making half of your plate fruits or vegetables. Then, fill the rest of the dish based on that constraint.</p>
<p><strong>9. Use the “Outer Ring” strategy to buy healthier foods.</strong> The concept is simple: when you go grocery shopping, don’t walk down the aisles. Only shop on the outer perimeter of the store. This is usually where the healthy food lives: fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, eggs, and nuts. If you only shop on the outer ring, then you&#8217;re more likely to buy healthy foods. And that, of course, means you&#8217;re more likely to eat healthy foods when you get home.</p>
<p><strong>10. And for the tenth strategy,</strong> let&#8217;s apply these concepts to some other areas of life&#8230;</p>
<h2>Applying Environment Design to the Rest of Your Life</h2>
<p>When you really break down each of these strategies, you’ll see that each one is a small tweak that puts more steps between you and the bad behaviors and fewer steps between you and the good behaviors.</p>
<p>For example&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrapping unhealthy foods in tin foil adds another step. You have to see the dish, then open it to see what is inside, then decide to eat it. (Rather than just spotting some leftovers in plastic wrap and grabbing them.)</li>
<li>Using small plates adds another step between you and eating more. If you want more, you have to go back for seconds and fill up again.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can take this same approach to almost anything in life. If you want to make a bad behavior more difficult, then increase the number of steps between you and the behavior.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want to make a good behavior easier, <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habit-guide">reduce the number of steps between you and the behavior</a>. For example, if you want to make it easier to go for a run then lay out your shoes and running gear the night before you exercise. One less step between you and your workout.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us know that junk food is unhealthy. We know that poor nutrition is related to heart problems, high blood pressure, and a host of other health ailments. You might even know that studies show that eating junk food has been linked to <a title="junk food depression" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21835082">increases in depression</a>.</p>
<p>But if it&#8217;s so bad for us, why do we keep doing it?</p>
<p>There is an answer. And the science behind it will surprise you.<br />
<span id="more-5359"></span></p>
<h2>Why We Crave Junk Food</h2>
<p>Steven Witherly is a food scientist who has spent the last 20 years studying what makes certain foods more addictive (and tasty) than others. Much of the science that follows is from his excellent report, <a title="Why Humans Like Junk Food by Steven Witherly" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/why-humans-like-junk-food-steven-witherly.pdf">Why Humans Like Junk Food</a>.</p>
<p>According to Witherly, when you eat tasty food, there are two factors that make the experience pleasurable.</p>
<p>First, there is the sensation of eating the food. This includes what it tastes like (salty, sweet, umami, etc.), what it smells like, and how it feels in your mouth. This last quality — known as &#8220;orosensation&#8221; — can be particularly important. Food companies will spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato chip. Their scientists will test for the perfect amount of fizzle in a soda. These factors all combine to create the sensation that your brain associates with a particular food or drink.</p>
<p>The second factor is the actual macronutrient makeup of the food — the blend of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that it contains. In the case of junk food, food manufacturers are looking for a perfect combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your brain and gets you coming back for more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how they do it&#8230;</p>
<h2>How Science Creates Cravings</h2>
<p>There are a range of factors that scientists and food manufacturers use to make food more addictive.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic contrast.</strong> Dynamic contrast refers to a combination of different sensations in the same food. In the words of Witherly, foods with dynamic contrast have &#8220;an edible shell that goes crunch followed by something soft or creamy and full of taste-active compounds. This rule applies to a variety of our favorite food structures — the caramelized top of a creme brulee, a slice of pizza, or an Oreo cookie — the brain finds crunching through something like this very novel and thrilling.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Salivary response.</strong> Salivation is part of the experience of eating food and the more that a food causes you to salivate, the more it will swim throughout your mouth and cover your taste buds. For example, emulsified foods like butter, chocolate, salad dressing, ice cream, and mayonnaise promote a salivary response that helps to lather your taste buds with goodness. This is one reason why many people enjoy foods that have sauces or glazes on them. The result is that foods that promote salivation do a happy little tap dance on your brain and taste better than ones that don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid food meltdown and vanishing caloric density.</strong> Foods that rapidly vanish or “melt in your mouth” signal to your brain that you’re not eating as much as you actually are. In other words, these foods literally tell your brain that you’re not full, even though you’re eating a lot of calories.</p>
<p>The result: you tend to overeat.</p>
<p>In his best-selling book, <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/salt-sugar-fat">Salt Sugar Fat</a> (<a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/audiobook/salt-sugar-fat">audiobook</a>), author Michael Moss describes a conversation with Witherly that explains vanishing caloric density perfectly&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste. He zeroed right in on the Cheetos. “This,” Witherly said, “is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.” He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more. But the one he focused on most was the puff’s uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said. “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Sensory specific response.</strong> Your brain likes variety. When it comes to food, if you experience the same taste over and over again, then you start to get less pleasure from it. In other words, the sensitivity of that specific sensor will decrease over time. This can happen in just minutes.</p>
<p>Junk foods, however, are designed to avoid this sensory specific response. They provide enough taste to be interesting (your brain doesn&#8217;t get tired of eating them), but it&#8217;s not so stimulating that your sensory response is dulled. This is why you can swallow an entire bag of potato chips and still be ready to eat another. To your brain, the crunch and sensation of eating Doritos is novel and interesting every time.</p>
<p><strong>Calorie density.</strong> Junk foods are designed to convince your brain that it is getting nutrition, but to not fill you up. Receptors in your mouth and stomach tell your brain about the mixture of proteins, fats, carbohydrates in a particular food, and how filling that food is for your body. Junk food provides just enough calories that your brain says, &#8220;Yes, this will give you some energy&#8221; but not so many calories that you think &#8220;That’s enough, I’m full.&#8221; The result is that you crave the food to begin with, but it takes quite some time to feel full from it.</p>
<p><strong>Memories of past eating experiences.</strong> This is where the psychobiology of junk food really works against you. When you eat something tasty (say, a bag of potato chips), your brain registers that feeling. The next time you see that food, smell that food, or even read about that food, your brain starts to trigger the memories and responses that came when you ate it. These memories can actually cause physical responses like salivation and create the &#8220;mouth-watering&#8221; craving that you get when thinking about your favorite foods.</p>
<p>All of this brings us to the most important question of all.</p>
<p>Food companies are spending millions of dollars to design foods with addictive sensations. What can you and I do about it? Is there any way to counteract the money, the science, and the advertising behind the junk food industry?</p>
<h2>How to Kick the Junk Food Habit and Eat Healthy</h2>
<p>The good news is that the research shows that the less junk food you eat, the less you crave it. My own experiences have mirrored this. As I&#8217;ve slowly begun to eat healthier, I&#8217;ve noticed myself wanting pizza and candy and ice cream less and less. Some people refer to this transition period as &#8220;gene reprogramming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever you want to call it, the lesson is the same: if you can find ways to gradually eat healthier, you&#8217;ll start to experience the cravings of junk food less and less. I&#8217;ve never claimed to have all the answers (or any, really), but here are three strategies that might help.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use the “outer ring” strategy and the “5 ingredient rule” to buy healthier food.</strong></p>
<p>The best course of action is to avoid buying processed and packaged foods. If you don’t own it, you can’t eat it. Furthermore, if you don’t think about it, you can’t be lured by it.</p>
<p>We’ve talked about the power of junk food to pull you in and how memories of tasty food in the past can cause you to crave more of it in the future. Obviously, you can’t prevent yourself from ever thinking about junk food, but there are ways to reduce your cravings.</p>
<p>First, you can use my <a title="outer ring strategy" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/simple-diet-ideas">“outer ring” strategy</a> to avoid processed and packaged foods at the grocery store. If you limit yourself to purchasing foods that are on the outer ring of the store, then you will generally buy whole foods (fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs, etc.). Not everything on the outer ring is healthy, but you will avoid a lot of unhealthy foods.</p>
<p>You can also follow the “5 ingredient rule” when buying foods at the store. If something has more than 5 ingredients in it, don&#8217;t buy it. Odds are, it has been designed to fool you into eating more of it. Avoid those products and stick with the more natural options.</p>
<p><strong>2. Eat a variety of foods.</strong></p>
<p>As we covered earlier, the brain craves novelty.</p>
<p>While you may not be able to replicate the crunchy/creamy contrast of an Oreo, you can vary your diet enough to keep things interesting. For example, you could dip a carrot (crunchy) in some hummus (creamy) and get a novel sensation. Similarly, finding ways to add new spices and flavors to your dishes can make eating healthy foods a more desirable experience.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: eating healthy doesn’t have to be bland. Mix up your foods to get different sensations and you may find it easier than eating the same foods over and over again. (At some point, however, you may have to <a title="stay focused" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/stay-focused">fall in love with boredom</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Find a better way to deal with your stress.</strong></p>
<p>There’s a reason why many people eat as a way to cope with stress. Stress causes certain regions of the brain to release chemicals (specifically, opiates and neuropeptide Y). These chemicals can trigger mechanisms that are similar to the cravings you get from fat and sugar. In other words, when you get stressed, your brain feels the addictive call of fat and sugar and you&#8217;re pulled back to junk food.</p>
<p>We all have stressful situations that arise in our lives. Learning to deal with stress in a different way can help you overcome the addictive pull of junk food. This could include simple breathing techniques or a <a title="guided meditation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpsfWkl5L08">short guided meditation</a>. Or something more physical like <a title="start working out" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/start-working-out">exercise</a> or <a title="make more art" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/make-more-art">making art</a>.</p>
<p>With that said, if you&#8217;re looking for a better written and more detailed analysis of the science of junk food, I recommend reading the #1 New York Times best-seller, <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/salt-sugar-fat">Salt Sugar Fat</a> (<a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/audiobook/salt-sugar-fat">audiobook</a>).</p>
<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>One of my goals with this article is to reveal just how complex poor eating habits can be. Junk food is designed to keep you coming back for more. Telling people that they &#8220;need more willpower&#8221; or should &#8220;just stop eating crap&#8221; is short-sighted at best.</p>

<p>There are choices that you make every day, some of which seem completely unrelated to your health and happiness, that dramatically impact the way you feel mentally and physically.</p>
<p>With that said, here are 10 common mistakes that can prevent you from being happy and healthy, and the science to back them up.</p>
<p><span id="more-5348"></span></p>
<h2>1. Avoiding deep and meaningful connections (like marriage, close friendships, and staying in touch with family)</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the human experience is about connecting with other people. Connection is what provides value and meaning to our lives. We&#8217;re wired for it and research proves just that.</p>
<p>For example, people with strong social ties <a title="social connections and health" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/425958">were found to be healthier and have a lower risk of death</a>. Additionally, it was found that as age increases, the <a title="live longer social connection" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15965141">people with stronger social ties tend to live longer</a>. And it seems that friendships can even <a title="fight cancer" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2224168">help you fight cancer</a>.</p>
<p>The benefits of deep relationships extend to marriage as well. Being in a long-term relationship <a title="marriage and health" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21200073">decreases the risk of depression, suicide, and substance abuse</a>. And <a title="marriage and health" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16905719">one study of almost 6,000 people</a> found that marriage led to increased longevity while never marrying was the strongest predictor of premature death.</p>
<p>Finally, multiple studies (<a title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11710357" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11710357">here</a>, <a title="okinawa life expectancy" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16611700">here</a>, and <a title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2822182/" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2822182/">here</a>) show that strong family ties are one of the primary reasons the people of Okinawa, Japan have incredible longevity despite being one of the poorest prefectures in the country.</p>
<p>What do all of these different studies tell us?</p>
<p>Connection and belonging are essential for a healthy and happy life. Whether it&#8217;s friendship, marriage, or family — humans need close connections to be healthy.</p>
<p>For more about the connection between loneliness and health, I suggest reading the New York Times best-seller <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/mind-over-medicine">Mind Over Medicine</a>, which was written by Dr. Lissa Rankin.</p>
<h2>2. Sitting all day.</h2>
<p>You might want to stand up for this. It turns out that sitting all day has more harmful effects than you might expect.</p>
<p>The short version is that &#8220;recreational sitting&#8221; like sitting in front of a TV screen increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, regardless of your physical activity. Obviously, sitting at a desk for work isn&#8217;t too good either.</p>
<p>This troubling data doesn&#8217;t come from small sample sizes either. These trends held true in one study with <a title="sitting health risks" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21232666">4,500 people</a>, <a title="sitting health risks" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20065160">another with 8,800 people</a>, and a <a title="sitting health risks" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22218159">final one with over 240,000 participants</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for more details on the health risks of sitting, <a title="health risks sitting" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17sitting-t.html">this New York Times article</a> covers some of the basics.</p>
<h2>3. Never stopping to just breathe.</h2>
<p>A few years ago, I was speaking with a yoga instructor who told me, &#8220;I think people love my class because it’s the only time in their entire day when they just sit and breathe.&#8221;</p>
<p>That provides some interesting food for thought. From the time you wake up until the time you go to bed, do you ever take 15 minutes to just sit and breathe? I rarely do. And that&#8217;s a shame because the benefits of mindfulness and meditation are huge. Meditation <a title="meditation benefits" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848393/">reduces stress and anxiety</a>. Meditation <a title="quality of life meditation" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921566/">improves your quality of life and boost your immune system</a>. Meditation has been shown to decrease anger and improve sleep, <a title="meditation sleep anger" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19477811">even among prison inmates</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Not becoming part of a community (possibly a religious one).</h2>
<p>There is an interesting and growing body of medical research that has discovered the positive health effects of religion and spirituality. The science doesn&#8217;t necessarily say that there is anything inherently healthy about religion, but it&#8217;s all the by-products that come from practicing religion that can make a big difference.</p>
<p>For example, people with strong faith often release control of their struggles and worries to a higher power, which can help to relieve anxiety and stress. Religious groups also offer a strong source of community and friendships, which is critical for health and happiness. In many cases, the strength of friendships formed with fellow believers can last for decades, and those strong personal ties are crucial for long-term health.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t consider yourself to be a religious person, then the lesson to takeaway from this body of research is that we all need a sense of belonging and community in our lives. It&#8217;s important to share your beliefs (whatever they happen to be about) with a community of people. People who have a community like that to lean on find themselves happier and healthier than those who lack that type of support.</p>
<p>As a starting point, you can read studies on the religion-health connection <a title="religion-health connection" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11308034">here</a>, <a title="religion-health connection" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9813743">here</a>, and <a title="religion-health connection" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11906445">here</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Ignoring your creative abilities.</h2>
<p>Expressing yourself creatively reduces the risk of disease and illness while simultaneously strengthening your health and wellness. For example, <a title="health benefits of creativity" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804629/">this study</a> from the Harvard School of Public Health revealed that art helps to reduce stress and anxiety, increase positive emotions, and reduce the likelihood of depression, along with many other benefits.</p>
<p><a title="health benefits of art" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039514">Another study</a>, which was published in the Journal of Biobehavioral Medicine, discovered that creative writing improved the immune system response of HIV patients. For more ideas on why creating art is healthy, read this: <a title="health benefits of creativity" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/make-more-art">The Health Benefits of Creativity</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Spending all day indoors.</h2>
<p>Exploring the world around you — whether that means traveling to faraway lands or hiking through the woods in your area — provides a wide range of mental and physical benefits. For starters, the benefits of sunlight (and the negative effects of artificial light) are <a title="sunlight benefits" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/">well-documented in research</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers have begun to discover that wilderness excursions — known as &#8220;adventure therapy&#8221; — can <a title="weight loss" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16158087">promote weight loss</a>, <a title="mental illness self-esteem adventure therapy" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23828947">improve the self-esteem of people with mental illness</a>, and even <a title="sex offenders adventure therapy" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20390776">reduce the rearrest rates of sex offenders</a>.</p>
<p>The central theme that runs through all of these studies is that exploring the outdoors and spending time in nature can increase the confidence you have in yourself and improve your ability to interact with others.</p>
<h2>7. Spending your time consuming instead of contributing.</h2>
<p>Contribution is an essential part of living a life that is happy, healthy, and meaningful. Too often we spend our lives consuming the world around us instead of creating it. We overdose on low quality information. We live sedentary lives and passively eat, watch, and soak up information rather than creating, contributing, and building our own things.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you cease to make a contribution, you begin to die.<br />
—Eleanor Roosevelt</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in <a title="short unimportant life" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/short-unimportant-life">this article</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can’t control the amount of time you spend on this planet, but you can control what you contribute while you’re here. These contributions don’t have to be major endeavors. Cook a meal instead of buying one. Play a game instead of watching one. Write a paragraph instead of reading one. You don’t have to create big contributions, you just need to live out small ones each day.&#8221;</p>
<h2>8. Working in a job that you don&#8217;t love.</h2>
<p>As you might expect, it&#8217;s dangerous to work too much. In Japan, the overtime and workplace stress has become so bad that they actually have a label for the people who die because of it: <em>karoshi</em>, which literally means &#8220;death by overwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basically any way in which your job makes you feel stressed is bad for your health — unpredictable commutes, tension and disagreement with your boss or coworkers, feeling undervalued or unappreciated. Even working overtime <a title="working overtime heart disease" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460389">increases the risk for coronary heart disease</a>, independent of outside factors.</p>
<p>What can you do about it? No one strategy will work for everyone, of course, but the principles in <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/the-happiness-advantage">The Happiness Advantage</a> by Shawn Achor offer a great place to start.</p>
<h2>9. Eating alone.</h2>
<p>Brian Wansink, a Cornell professor and author of <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/mindless-eating">Mindless Eating</a>, has written that when people eat alone they are more likely to have a large binge feeding. Additionally, diets suffer when people eat alone. Lonely diners tend to eat fewer vegetables and less healthy meals. It seems that we make less of an effort to eat well when we are by ourselves than when someone else is involved.</p>
<p>Given that an estimated <a title="eat lunch at desk" href="http://www.right.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2011-press-releases/item21650.aspx">one out of three people eat lunch at their desk</a>, it&#8217;s easy to see how these little choices add up to big health problems over the long-term.</p>
<h2>10. Believing that you are unworthy of health, happiness, and love.</h2>
<p>Brene Brown is a researcher at the University of Houston and she has spent 10 years studying vulnerability. In recent years, her work has exploded with popularity as she delivered <a title="brene brown ted talk" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o">one of the most popular TED Talks</a> of all-time and has written multiple best-selling books including <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/daring-greatly">Daring Greatly</a> and <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection">The Gifts of Imperfection</a>.</p>
<p>As Brown studied fear, uncertainty, and vulnerability, she discovered one key insight&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who struggle for it. And that was that people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they’re worthy of love and belonging.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>That’s it. They believe they’re worthy. The one thing that keeps us out of connection is the fear that we’re not worthy of connection.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>—</em>Brene Brown</p>
<p>If you allow your fear or vulnerability or shame to prevent you from showcasing your true self, then you will be preventing yourself from connecting fully with others. If you want to be able to move past fear, judgement, and uncertainty and into a healthier and happier life, then you have to give yourself permission first. You have to decide that you&#8217;re worthy.</p>
<p>For much deeper and more useful discussion of vulnerability, I suggest reading Brown&#8217;s books: <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/daring-greatly">Daring Greatly</a> and <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection">The Gifts of Imperfection</a>.</p>
<h2>What Do You Need to Be Healthy?</h2>
<p>Living a healthy life is about much more than just diet and exercise. Don&#8217;t forget about the 10 areas above because they play a significant role in your health and happiness.</p>
<p>As Lissa Rankin often says, &#8220;What does your body need to heal?&#8221;</p>
<p>In many cases it&#8217;s not a better diet or a new workout program, it&#8217;s one of these areas that might be impacting your health and happiness without you even realizing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adopting a <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/barry-marshall">philosophy of personal science and self-experimentation</a> can make a tremendous difference in your life.</p>
<p>Choosing to experiment with new ideas can help you start a successful business. Choosing to experiment with sharing your work can launch your career as a writer or an artist. And choosing to experiment with different diets and workouts can help you discover a fitness and health strategy that works for you.</p>
<p>Of course, self-experimentation is exactly the opposite of how most of us want to approach things. We would prefer that someone hand us a one-page sheet with the answers to our problems and say, “Do this and you’ll be good to go.” Furthermore, if someone shares an idea that seems outlandish or weird, most of us would rather dismiss it than experiment for six months to see if it can actually work for us.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I&#8217;ve made my fair share of mistakes and have dismissed ideas without trying them in the past. But in the case of intermittent fasting, which I’ll explain below, I’m glad that I decided to do some self-experimentation and see if it would work for me.</p>
<p>I’ve been experimenting with intermittent fasting for more than 2 years and this is what I’ve learned&#8230;</p>
<h2>Intermittent Fasting: What It Is and How I Do It</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple definition of intermittent fasting: you eat your normal amount of food in a smaller time frame. It&#8217;s not a diet, it&#8217;s just a pattern of eating that reduces your eating window each day to about 8 hours.</p>
<p>For example, I usually eat my first meal around 12pm or 1pm and then I can continue eating until my final meal at 8pm. After that, I fast until the next day at 12pm. That breaks out to about 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating each day. I do this almost every day. (My guess would be that I do intermittent fasting 350 out of 365 days per year.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to dive into the details of intermittent fasting in this article. I have previously written a <a title="intermittent fasting" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">3,000 word beginner’s guide to intermittent fasting</a> and a lengthy <a title="intermittent fasting" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/reader-mailbag-intermittent-fasting">question and answer guide on intermittent fasting</a>. If you have questions about how it works and the science behind it, read those articles.</p>
<p>And if you want even more information, I was also interviewed on the Fat Burning Man podcast (<a title="james clear intermittent fasting" href="http://www.fatburningman.com/james-clear-intermittent-fasting/">here</a>) and the Jimmy Moore’s live show about intermittent fasting (<a title="james clear intermittent fasting" href="http://ec.libsyn.com/p/9/4/8/94846162ea2eab83/ATLCX-48-clear.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01c08636d7c05ab358&amp;c_id=6228835">mp3 download here</a>).</p>
<h2>How I Feel After 2 Years of Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p><strong>1. The biggest benefit of intermittent fasting is simplicity.</strong></p>
<p>In an <a title="president obama vanity fair interview" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama">interview with Vanity Fair</a>, President Obama described an interesting strategy he uses to make his life simpler. “You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,” he said. “I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.”</p>
<p>What President Obama is referring to is a concept called &#8220;decision fatigue&#8221; and it can drastically impact your ability to make decisions throughout the day. I explained the science of decision fatigue in <a title="willpower and decision fatigue" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/willpower-decision-fatigue">this article</a>.</p>
<p>For the President, simplifying his clothing choices is a way to make life simpler and improve his decision making abilities. For me, intermittent fasting provides the same benefit. Eliminating breakfast and not thinking about food until 12pm each day has allowed me to reduce the number of decisions I make in the morning, thus reducing decision fatigue and increasing the willpower I have for the rest of the day. That means I have more energy to put toward doing work that is important to me.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to find happiness and success in life is to strip away the unnecessary things and focus only on what is needed.</p>
<p>With intermittent fasting, I have been able to increase strength, reduce body fat, and maintain good health while spending less time eating each day. If you can get the same results by making life simpler and only eating twice per day, why would you make life more complex by eating three, four, or five times per day?</p>
<p><strong>2. Intermittent fasting is an excellent travel strategy.</strong></p>
<p>I used to be annoyed by the lack of healthy food options in airports. This is especially true in my case because I’m looking bulk up and add good weight, so I need to eat a lot. Finding a sizable amount of healthy food is a tall task in most airports.</p>
<p>The solution? Treat your travel days as a fasting day and then eat twice as much good food the following day.</p>
<p>As an example, last year when I was flying back from Thanksgiving with my family, I didn’t eat that day. It ended up being about 32 hours between meals. That’s the longest I’ve gone on a single fast, but things worked out just fine and I avoided the poor nutrition of the airport.</p>
<p><strong>3. So far, intermittent fasting has not hurt my long-term health.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested in doing intermittent fasting if it sacrifices my long-term health for short-term improvements. And for that reason, I&#8217;ve kept a close eye on how I feel, how my body is responding, and whether my overall health is improving or declining.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’m in better shape than I was two years ago, which is proven by my strength numbers in the gym.</p>
<p>And more importantly, a recent checkup with my physician has revealed that my blood work, cholesterol, and hormones are in check as well. And remember, this is after two years of intermittent fasting. (If you&#8217;re interested, my recent blood work results are <a title="james clear blood work" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/james-clear-bloodwork.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Note: I think it&#8217;s important to clarify that I can only speak from my experience and I can’t promise anything with regards to how your body will respond to intermittent fasting. I know that, in some cases, women believe that intermittent fasting has thrown their hormones off balance. I don&#8217;t have any data on this and so all I can offer is my own experience. As with most things in life, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p><strong>4. Intermittent fasting isn’t a magic pill.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, I hoped that intermittent fasting alone would be a secret weapon for health and fat loss. It seemed like all of the experts were saying that if I changed what time I ate, then I would lose fat and gain muscle easily. That sounded good to me.</p>
<p>The reality, of course, is much different. I only started seeing the results I wanted when I combined intermittent fasting with a healthy diet of real, whole foods and consistent weightlifting.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting is just another tool in your toolbox. Just as eating a healthy diet of real, whole foods is another tool. And exercising regularly is another tool. And meditating or doing yoga to reduce stress is another tool. And sleeping at least 8 hours per night is another tool.</p>
<p>You can’t live an unhealthy life in other areas and expect one thing to solve all of your problems, but you can slowly add a piece here or there, continue to self-experiment, and gradually develop a health strategy that works for you, your goals, and your lifestyle.</p>
<p>In fact, I’m convinced that you can reach your health goals without intermittent fasting at all (if you eat properly and train consistently). But I still think intermittent fasting is worthwhile because, as I said above, if you could get the same results while eating fewer meals and making life simpler, why would you add more meals and make life complex?</p>
<p>On a related note, if you&#8217;re looking for a simple way to eat healthier foods check out my &#8220;outer ring&#8221; strategy in <a title="simple diet ideas" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/simple-diet-ideas">this article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. I have no idea if intermittent fasting will work for you.</strong></p>
<p>I can’t say whether intermittent fasting will work for you. All I know is that, as one piece of my overall strategy, it has worked for me. It works because it fits my lifestyle. It works because it is simple enough for me to not spend much energy thinking about it. And it works because it aligns well with my diet, which is mostly Paleo, and my training style, which is mostly Olympic weightlifting and other compound movements.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re eating poorly or if you&#8217;re training for an Iron Man or if your job doesn&#8217;t give you the flexibility to eat your meals in an 8-hour window, then intermittent fasting might not be for you. And that&#8217;s fine. You can experiment with other ways to achieve your goals.</p>
<h2>Where to Go From Here and What Actually Matters</h2>
<p>No one will have the same experience as you — with intermittent fasting or with anything else — and that&#8217;s why you have to experiment on your own.</p>
<p>It might be easier to cite a study or follow the advice of some diet guru, but the only way to get results is to test, adjust, and repeat. As someone who often cites academic research in their articles, I have the utmost respect for science. But you can&#8217;t let a research study make choices for you. They can inform you, sure. But the only way to make progress and change your life is to make new choices, take action, and make adjustments based on the results.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s intermittent fasting or something entirely different, I hope you&#8217;ll choose to run your own experiments and see what works for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to live a healthy life in the most effortless way possible.</p>
<p>I want to get my diet and nutrition right because it allows me to do the more important things in life, but I also don&#8217;t want to spend all day thinking about what I eat.</p>
<p>I think my time and energy should be spent building things that matter, pursuing adventure and exploring the world, connecting and sharing with the people around me, and working toward goals that are important to me.</p>
<p>Because of that, I have spent the last few months trying different strategies that make it easier for me to <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/eat-healthy">eat healthy</a> without much effort.</p>
<p>Most people get wrapped up in the details and strategies of a particular diet and never get around to actually following it. I like to keep things simple. I&#8217;d prefer to abandon the details, understand the main idea, and actually make adjustments.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have all the answers, of course, but here&#8217;s what is working for me right now and how you can use these ideas to eat healthy, lose weight, and gain muscle.</p>
<p><span id="more-5209"></span></p>
<h2>How to Buy Healthy Food Without Thinking</h2>
<p>The main idea of most good diets is the same: eat whole foods that are unprocessed and that grew or lived outdoors. Some of them have different variations — no animal products, no grains, etc. — but most of them fit the general &#8220;real food&#8221; mold.</p>
<p>The problem is that — if you’re anything like me — you will eat whatever is close to you, whether it came from Mother Nature or not. As a result, the best strategy is to surround yourself with healthy food.</p>
<p>Here’s how I do it&#8230;</p>
<p>When I go to the grocery store, I only walk around the &#8220;outer ring” of the store. I don’t walk down the aisles. The outer ring is where the healthy food usually lives: fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, eggs, and nuts. These are items that grew or lived outdoors. That’s what I eat.</p>
<p>The aisles are where all of the boxed and processed stuff is placed. Don’t go down those aisles and you won’t buy those foods. Don’t buy those foods and they won’t be around for you to eat.</p>
<p>Try this the next time you go to the store and do your best to not to make exceptions.</p>
<p>Sure, there will be the occasional time that you&#8217;ll need to go down an aisle to pick up spices or grab a bottle of olive oil, but this is rare. The last three times I’ve been at the grocery store, I have easily stayed on the &#8220;outer ring&#8221; and I bet you can do the same.</p>
<p>I know that I will eat everything around me, so I do my best to surround myself with good things. This is another way that I design my environment for success, which is a strategy that I wrote about in detail here: <a title="environment design" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/environment-design-organ-donation">Environment Design</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Eat Less Without Thinking</h2>
<p>A lot of people want to lose weight, burn fat, and build a lean body. Maybe you do too.</p>
<p>In my experience, the simplest way to do this is to buy healthier foods and eat less overall. If you combine these two strategies with consistency and exercise, then the rest usually takes care of itself. I already covered my simple approach to buying healthier food, so here are the two best strategies I’ve discovered for eating less.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> as with most diet ideas, these strategies should be used in moderation. There is a tremendous amount of social, cultural, and peer pressure in our world to &#8220;be thin.&#8221; The strategies I&#8217;m sharing below aren&#8217;t meant to promote that type of behavior. My goal is offer ideas that make it easier to live healthy in a sustainable way. Your ultimate goal should always be to regain your health and love yourself.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use smaller plates, bowls, pans, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Make less and serve less, and then you will eat less. These strategies work much better than relying on willpower or counting calories.</p>
<p>Multiple research studies have shown that you will always fill your plate to the brim and eat it clean. Given that, if you want to eat less, the best way to do so is to use smaller plates.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, making the switch to dark green plates might be a good idea as well because it will increase the amount of green vegetables that you eat.</p>
<p>I wrote about the science behind smaller plates and green plates in <a title="smaller plates" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/feeling-fat">this article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Eat fewer, but bigger, meals (i.e. switch to intermittent fasting)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">Intermittent fasting</a> is an eating schedule where you eat two bigger meals during an 8–hour span instead of three or four smaller meals throughout the day. Then, you fast for the other 16 hours of the day.</p>
<p>I have been practicing intermittent fasting for over 2 years (<a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/good-bad-intermittent-fasting">here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned</a>). My first meal is usually around 12pm and my last meal is usually around 8pm.</p>
<p>In theory, you could eat the same amount of food during two meals as you could during three. (In fact, I’m trying to gain muscle right now, so I’m trying to eat way more during my 8–hour feeding window.)</p>
<p>In practice, however, most people end up eating less when they switch from three meals to two meals. There is a certain amount of food that you consider to be a &#8220;meal&#8221; and you tend to eat that same amount whether you have two meals per day or three meals per day. The end result is that you eat less without thinking about it.</p>
<h2>What You Eat Is More Important Than When You Eat</h2>
<p>Intermittent fasting tends to help you burn fat and retain muscle. It also makes your life easier because you have one less meal to cook and clean. Those are my reasons for practicing intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to realize that <strong>what you eat will always be more important than when you eat.</strong></p>
<p>Intermittent fasting works best when combined with a healthy diet. You can&#8217;t pound Doritos from 12pm to 8pm and think that those extra pounds will magically fall away. Intermittent fasting is simply another weapon to use in the blubbery battle against fat — just like smaller plates and the &#8220;outer ring&#8221; strategy are weapons at your disposal.</p>

<h2>How to Eat Whatever You Want Without Feeling Guilty</h2>
<p>I think life is meant to be lived joyfully. I have no desire to judge myself for eating pizza or to feel guilty for drinking a beer.</p>
<p>But, I also know that I feel much better when I eat healthy. Plus, I love the idea of maximizing my potential and turning my body into an athletic machine.</p>
<p>Here’s how I balance the two&#8230;</p>
<p>I start by making sure that it&#8217;s easy for me to make the right choice, most of the time. The &#8220;outer ring&#8221; shopping strategy helps to make that possible and as a result, I eat whole foods 80% of the time.</p>
<p>Because I know that I&#8217;m already making good choices most of the time, I don&#8217;t worry about eating a soft pretzel at the ballpark or going out to get pizza with friends.</p>
<p>I also have a simple rule that I try to follow: <strong>whenever I eat an unhealthy meal, I follow it with a healthy one.</strong></p>
<p>Top performers <a title="get back on track" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/get-back-on-track">get back on track</a> faster than most people, and that&#8217;s what I try to do with my diet. I don&#8217;t worry about having fun and I try to enjoy life, but I also use this simple rule to guide me back toward a healthy diet as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>Avoid the Hype and Make Simple Changes</h2>
<p>I like simple rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t follow a diet plan. Instead, I shop on the outer ring of the store and buy foods that come from outdoors.</li>
<li>I don’t count calories. Instead, I let my intermittent fasting schedule regulate my eating.</li>
<li>I don’t judge myself when I eat something unhealthy. Instead, I try to follow it with a healthy meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these simple strategies I&#8217;ve been able to eat healthier without much effort or thought.</p>
<p>And most importantly, I&#8217;ve actually made improvements instead of getting bogged down in the details of a particular diet. When it comes to diets and nutrition, I think you are better off moving in the right direction rather than searching for the perfect direction.</p>
<p>Less effort, better food, and more time for what matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack LaLanne was a pioneer in the world of fitness.</p>
<p>The gyms that you see all over town? He opened one of the nation&#8217;s first fitness gyms in 1936.</p>
<p>The machines that fill those gyms? He invented dozens of them.</p>
<p>All of those home workout videos and television weight loss shows? He was the man who first brought fitness into your living room. <em>The Jack LaLanne Show</em> was the longest–running television exercise program of all time. It was on television for 34 years.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just his business career.</p>
<p>If you really want to be impressed, take a look at a handful of his personal fitness achievements.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the fitness feats that LaLanne accomplished&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>He swam from Alcatraz to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf in San Francisco while wearing handcuffs.</li>
<li>At age 42, he set the world record for pushups by doing over 1,000 in 23 minutes.</li>
<li>At age 45, he did 1,000 jumping jacks and 1,000 pullups in 1 hour and 22 minutes.</li>
<li>At age 60, he swam from Alcatraz to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf for the second time. This time he not only wore handcuffs, but also towed a 1,000 pound boat.</li>
</ul>
<p>LaLanne was in such remarkable shape that he could do one—armed fingertip pushups while in a completely stretched out position.</p>
<p>Ready for something really incredible?</p>
<p>To celebrate his 70th birthday, LaLanne swam 1.5 miles along the California coast from the Queen&#8217;s Way Bridge to Long Beach Harbor. And he did it while wearing handcuffs and shackles on his arms and legs and towing 70 row boats holding 70 people.</p>
<p>It sounds impossible, but the 70–year–old LaLanne finished the swim with all of the boats dragging along behind him.</p>
<h2>What Made Jack LaLanne Different?</h2>
<p>In some ways, LaLanne&#8217;s accomplishments are so out of the ordinary that it&#8217;s hard to translate them into our own lives. (I mean, I love doing fitness challenges, but I&#8217;m not planning to tow 70 boats anytime soon.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a lesson you can learn from Jack LaLanne that applies to nearly everything in your life. You won&#8217;t discover it by looking at his accomplishments, but rather, by examining his <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits">daily habits</a>.</p>
<h2>The Daily Routine of Jack LaLanne</h2>
<blockquote><p>The only way you can hurt the body is not use it.<br />
—Jack LaLanne</p></blockquote>
<p>LaLanne was a big believer in rituals and routines. He realized the power that consistent daily actions could have on his life.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the habits that Jack LaLanne did every day for decades&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lift weights and do strength training for 90 minutes.</li>
<li>Swim or run for 30 minutes (in addition to his strength training).</li>
<li>Eat 10 raw vegetables.</li>
<li>Eat two meals: a late breakfast and an early dinner (hmm&#8230; <a title="intermittent fasting" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">that</a> <a title="intermittent fasting" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/intermittent-fasting-lessons-learned">sounds</a> <a title="intermittent fasting" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/reader-mailbag-intermittent-fasting">familiar</a>).</li>
<li>Wake up at 4am (in his later years, LaLanne &#8220;slept in&#8221; until 5am).</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at that list. It&#8217;s not overly long, but imagine doing those things not just for one day or one week, but <em>for 60 years</em> like Jack LaLanne did.</p>
<p>Even at age 94, LaLanne was still exercising for two hours every day. 90 minutes of strength training. 30 minutes of swimming or walking. 10 raw vegetables. Every. Single. Day. For 60 years.</p>
<p>When we see someone who accomplishes something incredible, the easy way out is to discount it, chalk it up to natural talent or genetics, and claim that they were born with something you could never have. It takes the responsibility off of you. But the truth is that most incredible people — even the ones who accomplish superhuman feats — are simply more consistent than everyone else.</p>
<p>It was his incredible consistency that made Jack LaLanne superhuman.</p>
<p>When you look at Jack LaLanne&#8217;s life, it&#8217;s easy to focus on the big accomplishments and overlook the daily habits. Similarly, in your own life it&#8217;s easy to spend all of your time focused on transformations, big goals, and rapid changes, and forget that it&#8217;s the daily habits that lead to long–term success.</p>
<p><a title="good habits" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/why-is-it-so-hard-to-form-good-habits">Success is any field is about lifestyle choices, not life–changing transformations</a>. It&#8217;s your daily routine that will carry you to wherever it is you want to go.</p>
<h2>If Something is Important to You, Schedule It</h2>
<p>How did Jack LaLanne stick to his daily habits with such consistency?</p>
<p>Do you think he just waited until he felt motivated to workout each day? No way. His consistency has very little to do with <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/willpower">willpower</a> or <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/motivation">motivation</a>. Nobody is motivated every day for 60 years.</p>
<p>LaLanne knew what was important to him and so he scheduled it into his life. He started every day with strength training. Then he did his swimming and walking. Then he has his breakfast. Same order. Same time. Every time.</p>
<p>If you look at LaLanne&#8217;s daily habits, everything had a time and place when it was going to happen. <em>Can you say the same about your goals?</em></p>
<p>So often we tell ourselves things like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to eat healthier&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m going to workout more&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start writing more&#8221; &#8230; but we never say when and where these things are actually going to happen.</p>
<p>Carve out some time. Pick a date. Choose a place. Give your actions a time and a space to live.</p>
<p>LaLanne didn&#8217;t rely on his willpower or motivation. He just stuck to his daily schedule. <a title="professionals and amateurs" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/professionals-and-amateurs">That&#8217;s how all professionals approach their work</a>.</p>
<h2>Lessons from LaLanne: Keeping Life In Perspective</h2>
<p>In his later years, Jack LaLanne was fond of saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to die. It would ruin my image.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, he passed away at 96 years old. And in all of those years, I think one of his greatest accomplishments was holding on to his happiness as much as his health. Even with all of his fitness achievements, LaLanne didn’t ruin the rest of his life in pursuit of a particular goal.</p>
<p>The balance between achievement and happiness is something that I think about often – not just in my own life, but also in what I write on this site. I&#8217;m still working on it, but I believe that you don&#8217;t have to be dissatisfied to be driven. There&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t love the life you have and want to make it better at the same time.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not easy. Happiness and gratefulness require constant tending, much like diet and exercise. Your happiness and your health form the basic foundation of your life. There&#8217;s nothing new or complex about this — despite what the newest commercials for health products, new drugs, and fitness programs want you to believe.</p>
<p>This balance between happiness and achievement is something that I&#8217;m working on getting better at myself. What Jack LaLanne showed us — not just in his words, but also through how he lived — is that you can do incredible things and have a wonderful time while doing it.</p>
<h2>Learning From Jack LaLanne</h2>
<p>Jack LaLanne lived an incredible life, and he mastered something that we can all benefit from: the daily routine.</p>
<p>Is there a skill that is more valuable than the ability to consistently work towards goals that are important to you while maintaining a sense of perspective and happiness?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the incredible achievements, but rather your daily habits that determine who you are and what you accomplish. Get your habits handled, and the rest will fall into place. If we can take this small lesson and apply it to our lives, there is no doubt we will all be better off for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first Reader Mailbag!</p>
<p>I’m taking a page from the playbook of one of my favorite sportswriters, Bill Simmons, and answering a boatload of your questions today.</p>
<p>Questions are rolling in all the time — mostly through the <a title="free newsletter" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/newsletter">free newsletter</a> or <a title="Follow James Clear on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jamesclear">Twitter</a> — and I love hearing from you. Keep them coming! I&#8217;m happy to help however I can.</p>
<p>My hope is that this mailbag (and the ones that follow) will bring useful answers together in one place and make it easier for you to find the information you need to make the changes you want. My goal is always to make it easier for you to lose fat, gain muscle, and live healthy.</p>
<p>Boom. Let’s get this party rolling.</p>
<p>As always, these are real emails from real readers.</p>
<h2>Questions About How to Start Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started with some questions about what intermittent fasting is, common mistakes that people make, and how to get started properly&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been following the Paleo diet for the last 2 months and I am getting interested in trying an intermittent fasting protocol. Should I wait longer before starting a protocol? Or is it advisable to jump into one, being that it&#8217;s been a relatively short period of time with the new diet?<br />
—Chris P.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This is a good question to start with.</p>
<p>As Chris said, there are different styles (or &#8220;protocols&#8221;) of intermittent fasting. So, the first step is deciding which one to do. To make it easy for you, I broke down the major types of intermittent fasting and how to do them in the <a title="intermittent fasting beginner's guide" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">beginner&#8217;s guide to intermittent fasting</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I do a daily fast where I eat all of my meals in an 8–hour window (for example, from 1pm to 9pm) and then spend the rest of the day and night fasting.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s important to note that intermittent fasting isn&#8217;t a diet. It&#8217;s simply a schedule for eating. Or to put it another way, intermittent fasting is about when you eat, not what you eat. Of course, you&#8217;ll probably see better results if you&#8217;re eating a diet of real, unprocessed foods in addition to intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>This brings me to the second part of Chris&#8217; question. If you feel comfortable with your diet (whether it&#8217;s new or old), then I see no reason to wait to start intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>That said, if handling your new diet and intermittent fasting at the same time is too complicated, then start by focusing on one part and then move on to the next.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it many times, but if you want to <a title="identity-based habits" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/identity-based-habits">create habits that actually stick</a>, then you need to start as small as possible. Instead of getting inspired and trying to change every aspect of your health at the same time, make small changes one at a time and actually stick to them for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Do I start counting my 16 hours of fasting after completing the meal or by the time I had my first intake of the meal? For example, if I start my final meal at 8pm and finish it by 9pm, does my fasting period start at 8pm or 9pm?<br />
— Pradeep<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the simplest way to think about it: the fast starts when you stop eating. So in the example above, the fast would start when you finish the meal at 9pm.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Have you had any experience with skipping breakfast, but still having coffee in the morning?<br />
—Darius B.</strong></p>
<p>Does 20 calories of cream in my coffee hurt?<br />
—Bradley</p>
<p>Can I have tea during my fast?<br />
—My Mom</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true. My wonderful, shining, radiant mother has joined the intermittent fasting nation. And from what I can tell, it&#8217;s been an easy transition for her. Mothers of the world, we look forward to having you on our team in the near future.</p>
<p>As for having coffee or tea during your fast — you should be just fine. As a general rule of thumb, if you drink something with less than 50 calories, then your body will remain in the fasted state. So, your coffee with a splash of milk or cream is just fine. Tea should be no problem either.</p>
<p>In general, I think it&#8217;s a great idea to drink while fasting. Personally, I don&#8217;t drink coffee, but I do guzzle an incredible amount of water each day. Regardless of what you pour down, make sure you stay hydrated.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Dude! I’m a big believer in Intermittent Fasting. I basically don’t use any supplements and am GETTING RIPPED OUTTA MA MIND!<br />
—Omer F.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>You sir, are insane.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Can I have a fruit or two fruits (apple and banana) between meals? For example, first meal at 1pm, fruit at 4pm, second meal at 8pm.<br />
—Pradeep<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This is a great question because it should clear up some confusion about intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>You can eat whatever you want during the 8–hour period. Think of it as a feeding window and a fasting window. You&#8217;re not limited to two meals or three meals or some arbitrary number of eating times. During the eating period, you can eat whenever you want.</p>
<p>I tend to eat two meals because it&#8217;s easier to have a lot of food at once than it is for me to snack continuously and because it provides a clear start and finish to my eating throughout the day.</p>
<p>Another way to think of it: you are fasting after your meals, not between them.</p>
<h2>Questions about Exercise and Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p>A lot of people have questions about how to exercise and train while fasting. Here are some good questions that should push you in the right direction with your training.</p>
<p><strong><br />
I wanted to thank you both for writing such a fantastic, motivating blog and for introducing me to intermittent fasting. I am enjoying watching my weight go down by basically doing something that involves no effort — skipping breakfast! I was hoping you could elaborate more on your exercise routine. I have waded through the Leangains site and the other links you mentioned in the <a title="intermittent fasting beginner's guide" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">beginner&#8217;s guide</a>, and while very interesting, they are WAY too complex for me at this stage.<br />
—Paul S.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Readers like Paul are what make our community great. He read about an idea that interested him and even though some of the details were overwhelming, he didn&#8217;t let that prevent him from taking action. In other words, he <a title="start before you feel ready" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/successful-people-start-before-they-feel-ready">started before he felt ready</a>.</p>
<p>I try to make my writing as easy as possible to use, but it&#8217;s always up to you to experiment and see if it makes sense for your circumstances. Keep up the good work, Paul!</p>
<p>Back to the question&#8230;</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting works great with most strength training programs.</p>
<p>I believe in strength training and compound movements. I think 99% of the population could get in the best shape of their life with only eight exercises: snatch, clean and jerk, squat, bench press, deadlift, pushups, pullups, and sprints. If you did those exercises and did them well, then that&#8217;s all you would ever need.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing right now&#8230;</p>
<p>I train three days per week and I pick one exercise that is my primary goal for each workout. For example, tomorrow will be squat. My only goal is to have the 5 sets of 5 reps be the best form with the best weight I can do for that day. Anything else that I do after that is just bonus time. This gives me flexibility if my schedule is tight (it often is) and leeway to add something in if I have extra energy. For example, I might add some pullups onto the end of tomorrow&#8217;s squat workout.</p>
<p>When it comes to training volume and intermittent fasting, you&#8217;ll want to keep a few things in mind. First, when fasting it&#8217;s very possible that you can get better results by exercising less. This can either mean less frequently or less intensity. Most people will be on a calorie deficit while intermittent fasting, so it&#8217;s usually a good idea to exercise less rather than more.</p>
<p>That said, some people will want to train a lot and are still looking for ways to get lean and shed some fat. If this is the case, then you need to eat a lot (and I mean a lot) during your feeding window. For a brief period, I did intermittent fasting while training on an Olympic weightlifting team and I can tell you that I had to be very committed to eating to make it work. If you don&#8217;t eat a lot then your body is going to struggle to recover from intense training.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Thanks for all the great information. I’m on day 4 of my intermittent fasting journey. The first two days were easy, but I spent the 3rd day at home and it was tougher. I’m a triathlete and do most of my training at 5:30am, and I’ve still been able to fast from 7pm to around 11am the next day. I don’t do heavy lifting so I think I’m ok fasting after a workout. What do you think?<br />
—Bradley<br />
</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to training while fasting, my primary suggestion is to keep track of how you feel and base your decisions off of that.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have never had trouble when doing strength training while fasting. As long as you&#8217;re getting good nutrition within the 24 hours before and after training, you probably have nothing to worry about when it comes to training fasted.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;re going to do endurance training (like the triathlons that Bradley is training for), then I would be more careful.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to pay attention to your body. If you don&#8217;t feel good training on an empty stomach, then guess what? Your body is trying to tell you something. There&#8217;s no reason to be stupid about it. Try it out, pay attention to your energy, and see how your body reacts.</p>
<p><strong><br />
I workout before work at 6:30am and I&#8217;m looking to do a 16/8 fast. My last pre–training meal is at 8pm and my first meal after training is at about 1pm. Could this work or should my post–workout meal come sooner after working out?<br />
—Neville K.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I try to eat my biggest meal of the day post–workout. Usually this meal comes within an hour or two of working out. In my experience, this is what has worked best for me.</p>
<p>That said, Neville&#8217;s situation is a good lesson on choosing your goals. If fat loss is the most important thing for you, then I would probably stick with the 1pm meal. The primary benefits of fasting come around 12 to 16 hours after your last meal.</p>
<p>If training heavy, bulking up, and gaining muscle is at the top of the list, then I would probably scrap the intermittent fasting and get a big meal right after working out. In other words, it comes down to your priorities.</p>
<p>If you are in Neville&#8217;s situation and your post–workout meal comes in the middle of the workday, then it can be easy to find yourself caught up in the day&#8217;s affairs and running to the nearest Subway at the last minute. It&#8217;s probably a worthwhile investment of your time to plan out your meals in advance so that you can be sure that you can refuel with high quality nutrition after your workout.</p>
<h2>Concerns and Adjustments With Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p>Intermittent fasting is becoming popular, but it&#8217;s still not the &#8220;normal&#8221; thing to do. As a result, you may have some concerns about it or you may want to make some adjustments to your intermittent fasting schedule. Here are some common questions I&#8217;ve seen that should help point you in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong><br />
What if I ate my first meal at breakfast, skipped lunch, and then ate my second meal at dinner time?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This idea would work well for one reason, but not well for another reason. Let&#8217;s talk about both.</p>
<p>First, if your goal is to lose weight, then skipping lunch should help because it decreases the number of calories that you&#8217;re eating throughout the day. As I said in my article on <a title="intermittent fasting lessons learned" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/intermittent-fasting-lessons-learned">lessons learned from 1 year of intermittent fasting</a>, even if you try to eat two large meals instead of three regular meals, it&#8217;s hard to get the same number of calories. Even if you want to eat more, you often end up eating less.</p>
<p>So the end result of skipping lunch is that you would probably reduce your overall caloric intake and end up losing weight.</p>
<p>However, one of the primary benefits of intermittent fasting is that it puts you in a fat burning state. In other words, fasting makes it more likely that you&#8217;ll burn fat and not muscle.</p>
<p>This is where skipping lunch gets tricky. After you eat a meal, your body spends a few hours processing and digesting that food. Once you digest your food, you enter what is known as the &#8220;post–absorptive state.&#8221; You remain in this state until 8 to 12 hours after your last meal, and only then do you enter the fasted state.</p>
<p>In other words, you need to have at least 8 to 12 hours off from eating before your body enters the fasted, fat–burning state. This is why you want to squish your meals into a smaller time frame rather than spreading them throughout the day.</p>
<p>While skipping lunch would decrease the overall number of calories and probably help you lose weight in the long run, it would also spread your meals out and make it harder to get past that post–absorptive state and reach the fasted state. If you want the benefits of intermittent fasting, then you need to be fasting for at least 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong><br />
I shouldn&#8217;t have much trouble skipping breakfast during the week, but I&#8217;m worried that I can&#8217;t stick to intermittent fasting on the weekends. Is that alright?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes. This is a good lesson for any new habit or behavior change that you want to make in your life.</p>
<p>Just because you can&#8217;t do intermittent fasting on Saturday and Sunday, doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not worth doing during the week. Those two days don&#8217;t eliminate the benefits you get from doing it for the other five days.</p>
<p>This same philosophy applies to everything from lifting weights and eating healthy to creating art and writing thank you notes. Is eating one healthy meal each week better than eating none? You bet. Is squatting once per month better than not squatting at all? Damn straight.</p>
<p>Just because you don&#8217;t do something as often as you like, doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t do it as often as you can.</p>
<p><strong><br />
My one concern is that I will lose muscle mass (that I&#8217;ve worked really hard to gain) along with fat. Any quick recommendations for not losing too much muscle as I look to cut 15 pounds of fat? Or are my fears unwarranted?<br />
—Ryan F.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Ryan is asking a good question here.</p>
<p>To put it simply: gaining weight (hopefully muscle) requires a calories surplus and losing weight (hopefully fat) requires a calorie deficit. It should be obvious that you can&#8217;t have both of those at the same time.</p>
<p>As a result, if you&#8217;re going to lose weight, then it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll lose a little muscle along with the fat. Intermittent fasting comes in to save the day because it allows you to lose more fat and keep more muscle than you usually would.</p>
<p>In my experience, the key to maintaining muscle mass while dropping fat is to make sure that you eat enough high quality protein (and enough food in general). The basic rule of thumb is 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. So, if you weight 150 pounds, make sure you get 150 grams of protein each day. If you want to boost that a little bit, up to 1.5 grams per pound, then that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><strong><br />
The biggest thing I&#8217;m struggling with when it comes to intermittent fasting is getting enough food in during the hours available. I&#8217;m working, coaching CrossFit, and trying to train, so time is precious. What has your experience been with this?<br />
—Mark K.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I totally get it. It&#8217;s tough to get down enough food when you&#8217;re only eating two meals instead of three.</p>
<p>Like many of you, Mark has a packed schedule. I probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that cooking is basically impossible during the work day. In the end, I think the best answer is to plan your meals out ahead of time. It&#8217;s not a sexy answer, but having food made, prepped, and ready to eat beforehand is what allows you to eat enough when things get busy.</p>
<p>I would also suggest thinking about your entire eating window as an open feeding zone. Don&#8217;t box yourself into &#8220;2 meals&#8221; which can make it hard to get enough food down. During your 8–hour feeding window, you can eat whenever you want.</p>
<p>Related: While I haven&#8217;t done this myself, one of my friends cooks 90% of his food during one day each week. Then, he boxes it up and has all of his meals ready to go throughout the week. If you can fit a 5–hour cooking spree into your Sunday afternoon, for example, then you can be sure that you&#8217;ll have a lot of food ready during those busy weekdays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people would like to <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/eat-healthy">eat healthy</a> on a consistent basis. And even if you already eat healthy most of the time, it&#8217;s likely that you could do a better job of staying on target.</p>
<p>The benefits of good nutrition are obvious: you have more energy, your health improves, and your productivity blossoms.</p>
<p>So if we want to eat healthy and if it&#8217;s obvious why we should eat healthy, how come it&#8217;s so difficult to actually eat healthy?</p>
<p>And most importantly, is there anything we can do to make it easier?</p>
<p><span id="more-4045"></span></p>
<h2>Short–Term Goals vs. Long–Term Goals</h2>
<p>I used to be terrible at achieving long–term goals.</p>
<p>I was decent when working on short deadlines, but if a project lasted more than a month, then my <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/productivity">time management</a> was totally off. I used to feel bad about this, like I was the only one who couldn&#8217;t properly execute on a big goal. But as I&#8217;ve started to pay more attention to people who are good with long–term projects, my tune has changed.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone is good at achieving long–term goals.</p>
<p>Some people are just good at breaking long–term goals down into short–term ones. They have a small chunk that they work on each day or week and at the end of the project, they enjoy this big, beautiful result.</p>
<p><a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits">Good habits</a> — eating healthy, for example — work in much the same way. Some people are really good at breaking their long–term desires down into small behaviors that they can focus on each day. In other words, they are good at focusing on lifestyle choices rather than their life–changing goals. (More on that <a title="habits" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/why-is-it-so-hard-to-form-good-habits">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Eventually, these daily actions cascade into powerful, life–changing habits. But like a successful long–term project, a good habit starts with breaking the end goal down into very small steps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not great with long–term goals yet, but I&#8217;m getting better. And I&#8217;ve learned a lot about the process along the way. For example, here&#8217;s one way you could use this process to start eating healthy&#8230;</p>
<h2>Breaking Down the Steps of Eating Healthy</h2>
<p>Good habits are smaller than you think. We often get caught up in the end goal and think that we need to do it all at once, but usually it&#8217;s best to start with a very small section of our overall goal.</p>
<p>For example, many people want to eat healthy, but quickly find out how much work it takes to change their diet.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of what you need to do if you want to eat healthy&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to buy new groceries.</li>
<li>You have to prepare healthy food.</li>
<li>You have to eat healthy food.</li>
<li>You have to clean up and do the dishes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re the type of person who eats out often, then those four steps represent a huge shift in your daily life. It’s unlikely that you’ll change all of those things at once. I believe that most diets fail not because of a lack of <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/willpower">willpower</a> or <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/motivation">motivation</a>, but because we bite off more than we can chew.</p>
<p>Take a look at that list again. If you&#8217;re trying to change all of those things at the same time, it&#8217;s no wonder that it&#8217;s hard to stick to diet.</p>
<p>But imagine a different scenario&#8230;</p>
<h2>The Minimalist Approach to Eating Healthy</h2>
<p>What if you eliminated everything except the most critical part of the new habit?</p>
<p>For example, what if you did these 3 things&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Start <a title="intermittent fasting" href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">intermittent fasting</a>, so that you only need to eat two healthy meals per day instead of three.</li>
<li>For the first two months dieting, you buy disposable plates to minimize clean up time.</li>
<li>For the first month, you hire someone on Craigslist to cook a healthy dinner for you 5 nights per week. (This is surprisingly inexpensive. I&#8217;ve seen options for around $10/meal and it would ensure that you eat healthy after work each night without having to cook.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I realize that buying disposable plates and hiring someone to cook your meals is expensive, but we&#8217;re not talking about doing this forever. We&#8217;re just talking about making the habit easier to start with. We&#8217;re talking about making an investment for the first month or two, so that you make it as easy as possible to start eating healthy.</p>
<p>With our setup above, the only thing you focus on doing for the first month is actually eating healthy meals. In the second month, you start buying healthier groceries and cooking your meals. In the third month, you stop buying disposable plates and do the full clean up.</p>
<p>Imagine how much easier it is to eat healthy when you take those barriers away at the beginning.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Do It All, Just Start Doing It</h2>
<p>Obviously, you can manipulate this basic strategy to fit your needs. If you can&#8217;t afford to hire someone for 5 meals per week, then how about 2 meals per week? Do whatever works for you, but the general idea is to eliminate everything except the most essential task in the beginning.</p>
<p>Break down the goal into small chunks, remove the excuses, and make it as easy as possible to say yes to your new habit. You don&#8217;t have to do it all, you just have to start doing it.</p>
<p>It might require an investment, but would you rather simplify the process, pay a bit more now, and actually stick to a healthy diet &#8230; or try to do everything at once, drain all of your willpower, and quit out of frustration two weeks later?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re serious about long–term change, then smaller is better, especially at the start. Break down your long–term desires into short–term habits and you&#8217;ll find success comes much easier.</p>
<p>P.S. If you want more practical ideas for how to build new habits (and break bad ones), check out my book <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/book/atomic-habits"><em>Atomic</em> <em>Habits</em></a>, which will show you how small changes in habits can lead to remarkable results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I posted a brief guide on getting started with intermittent fasting. You can read it <a href="https://jamesclear.vercel.app/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">here</a>.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting is a great tool for getting strong and lean without changing your diet. But it can also seem confusing or extreme if you&#8217;re not familiar with it. In fact, my guide seemed to prompt quite a few questions, many of which I responded to over email.</p>
<p>Because you may be wondering many of the same things, I figured I should write about them here as well as share some of the important lessons I&#8217;ve learned from practicing intermittent fasting for over one year.</p>
<p><span id="more-2774"></span></p>
<h2>12 Lessons Learned from 1 Year of Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p><strong>1. The biggest barrier is your own mind.</strong></p>
<p>Implementing this diet is pretty simple, you just don&#8217;t eat when you wake up. Then you eat and lunch and go about your day. At least, that&#8217;s how I do it.</p>
<p>But there is a mental barrier to get over. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t eat will I not be able to think? Will I faint? Will I feel sick? What will it be like?&#8221; These are all thoughts that went through my mind before I started.</p>
<p>What ended up happening? Nothing. Life went on just fine.</p>
<p>Thinking you need to eat every 3 hours or six meals a day or always have breakfast or whatever it is that you’re convinced you have to do to survive &#8230; is all mental. You believe it because you were told it, not because you actually tried it.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve noticed that separates successful people from unsuccessful ones in life it&#8217;s not just the ability to think differently, but the ability to act differently as well.</p>
<p><strong>2. Losing weight is easy.</strong></p>
<p>When you eat less frequently you tend to eat less overall. As a result, most people who try intermittent fasting end up cutting weight. You might plan big meals, but consistently eating them is difficult in practice.</p>
<p>For this reason, I think intermittent fasting is a great option for people who are looking to lose weight because it offers a simple way to cut down on the total number of calories you eat without changing your diet. Even if you tell people that they can eat two large meals at lunch and dinner, they typically end up eating fewer calories than they would at 3 or 4 normal meals.</p>
<p>Most people lose weight while intermittent fasting because when they cut out meals, they don&#8217;t make up for it with bigger meal sizes.</p>
<p><strong>3. Building muscle is quite possible (if that&#8217;s what you want).</strong></p>
<p>I have managed to gain weight while intermittent fasting (I&#8217;ve added about 12 pounds of lean body mass and cut 5 pounds of fat over the last year), but only because I have focused on eating a lot during my feeding period.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the natural tendency is to lose weight on intermittent fasting because it&#8217;s easy to eat less when you cut a meal out of your day. However, at the end of the day eating 2,000 calories is eating 2,000 calories whether it comes during a 16–hour span or an 8–hour span. It just takes more effort to make sure you eat it all within 8 hours.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s totally reasonable to build muscle as long as you eat enough.</p>
<p><strong>4. My best work is usually done when I&#8217;m deep into my fast.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m most productive during the first 3 hours of my morning, which is about 12 to 15 hours into my daily fast. This is the exact opposite of what I expected when I started out. I assumed that if I didn&#8217;t eat for hours, then I wouldn&#8217;t have any energy to think. The reality is just the opposite.</p>
<p>I have a lot of mental clarity in the morning when I fast. I can&#8217;t say for certain if this is due to the fasting or the fact that I&#8217;m just refreshed when I wake up, but one thing is clear: fasting is not hindering my ability to get things done in the morning. In fact, I&#8217;m almost always more productive in the morning when I&#8217;m fasted than in the afternoon when I&#8217;m fed.</p>
<p><strong>5. For best results, cycle what you eat.</strong></p>
<p>Intermittent fasting works, but I didn&#8217;t start cutting fat at a significant rate until I added in calorie cycling and carb cycling to my diet. Here&#8217;s how it works&#8230;</p>
<p>I cycle calories by eating a lot on the days that I workout and less on the days that I rest. This means I have a calorie surplus on the days I train and a calorie deficit on the days that I rest. The idea behind this is that you can build muscle on the days you train and burn fat on the days you rest. And by the end of the week, you should have done both.</p>
<p>Additionally, I cycle carbs by eating a lot of carbohydrates on the days that I train and few carbohydrates on the days that I rest. This is done to stimulate fat loss. I eat high protein all the time and moderate to low fat on most days. Cycling carbohydrates has also led to additional fat loss.</p>
<p>For me, this is when the intermittent fasting seemed to pay off the most — when I coupled it with calorie cycling and carb cycling.</p>
<p><strong>6. Like most things, you should take a long–term view of eating.</strong></p>
<p>Too often we think about our diet in super short timeframes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to think about what we eat over the course of a week than over the course of a day (or worse, a few hours). For example, whether or not you have a protein shake within 30 minutes of working out, is largely a non–issue if you&#8217;re getting a meal of quality protein within 24 hours of working out.</p>
<p>One reason intermittent fasting works is because the super short timeframes that we are pitched by food companies and supplement companies are largely a myth. Let&#8217;s say you eat 3 quality meals per day. That&#8217;s 21 meals per week. Over the course of a week, do you think your body cares if the meals are eaten from 8am to 8pm (the normal eating schedule) or 1pm to 8pm (an intermittent fasting schedule)?</p>
<p>How about if we stretch it out over the course of a month? Wouldn&#8217;t it make sense that if you ate 80 quality meals every month (about 3 per day) that your body would make the most of those meals whether you ate them in an 8–hour block or a 12–hour block on each individual day?</p>
<p>When you take a slightly longer view, you start to realize that the time difference between eating from 8am to 8pm versus eating from 1pm to 8pm isn&#8217;t that large over the course of a week or a month.</p>
<p><strong>7. It&#8217;s strange, but when I&#8217;m fasting I want food <em>less</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Now that I’ve started fasting, I want food less. I’m not addicted to it. I’m not a victim to my diet. I eat when I want because I want to, not because my body tells me I have to.</p>
<p>This is a marked change from my previous eating schedule and I think the additional power and flexibility I have over my diet now is a benefit.</p>
<p><strong>8. Losing fat and gaining muscle can both be done, just not together.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to lose fat and build muscle mass, then the combination of intermittent fasting, calorie cycling, and carb cycling that I have mentioned here is one of the best solutions you&#8217;ll find.</p>
<p>You see, it&#8217;s basically impossible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you take in. You need to have a net calorie deficit.</p>
<p>To build muscle, you need to eat more calories than you burn. You need to have a net calorie surplus.</p>
<p>It should be fairly obvious that you can&#8217;t have a net surplus and a net deficit at the same time. For example, you can either eat more than 2,000 calories or you can eat less than 2,000 calories &#8230; but you can&#8217;t do both at the same time. This is why it&#8217;s basically impossible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time.</p>
<p>However, if we get away from the small timeframes and start thinking about our diet over the course of a week or a month, then we start to have more options. For example, let&#8217;s say that you workout 3 days per week. You could organize your eating routine to have a calorie surplus on the days you train (i.e. gain muscle) and then a calorie deficit on the days you rest (i.e. lose fat). That way, by the end of the week, it&#8217;s possible for you to have spent 3 days gaining muscle and 4 days losing fat.</p>
<p><strong>9. When fasting, I have made more gains by training less.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently began testing a new hypothesis for strength training, which I call &#8220;Do The Most Important Thing First.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as simple as it sounds. I pick one goal for the workout and do the most important exercise first. Everything else is secondary. For example, right now I&#8217;m working out Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I do two sessions each day. Upper body in the morning. Lower body in the evening. But I&#8217;m only doing one exercise each time (pushups in the morning) and squat or deadlift in the evening. If I feel like it, I&#8217;ll finish my evening workout with kettlebell work or bodyweight stuff (handstands, front levers, and so on).</p>
<p>The results have been very good. I&#8217;ve seen improvement each and every week over the last three months. It&#8217;s worked so well that I&#8217;m starting to think that it has very little to do with fasting, but instead is just a better way of training. I&#8217;ll write more about this in the future, but I wanted to note it here because when I compare it to the previous way I trained while fasting (snatch and clean and jerk three days per week, plus squat or deadlift), I seem to be making more progress.</p>
<p><strong>10. As long as you stay under 50 calories, you&#8217;ll remain in the fasted state.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people like to start their day with a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice. Maybe you&#8217;re one of them. I have a glass of water. Well you don&#8217;t have to dump your morning routine if you want to give fasting a try.</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that if you stay under 50 calories, then you&#8217;ll remain in the fasted state. I&#8217;m not sure where this number came from, but I&#8217;ve seen it dished around by enough reputable people that I&#8217;m going to go with it for now. Following the opinion of the majority is typically a lazy move, but in this case I think you&#8217;ll be alright if you want to have a cup of coffee in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>11. Prepare to drink a lot of water.</strong></p>
<p>I drank a lot of water before I began intermittent fasting, but now I drink an incredible amount. I&#8217;m usually over 8 glasses for the day by the time I get done with lunch.</p>
<p>You mileage may vary, but even if you don&#8217;t drink as much water as I do, I recommend having it at the ready.</p>
<p><strong>12. The best diet for you is the one that works for you.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone wants to be handed the ultimate diet plan. We all want the answers on one sheet of paper. “Here. Just do this and you’ll be set.”</p>
<p>This is why diet books sell so well. A lot of people are willing to pay for a quick fix, a diet in a box, or the nutritional solution to long life.</p>
<p>Here’s my problem with marketers telling everyone that their diet is the best: it’s like telling the whole world to wear medium sized shirts and then wondering why they don’t fit a lot of people.</p>
<p>In most ways, your body is the same as everyone else’s. But in some very important ways, it’s also different than everyone else’s. To find the diet that works best for you, you need to experiment and see what your body responds to.</p>
<p>This is why I enjoy intermittent fasting. You can play with your eating schedule very easily. Choose one that fits your lifestyle and that your body responds to. Once you figure out when you should be eating, then you can move on to the harder part: what you should be eating.</p>
<p>As always, your mileage will vary, but the most important thing is that you&#8217;re covering ground and moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been intermittent fasting for over one year.</p>
<p>I skip breakfast each day and eat two meals, the first around 1pm and the second around 8pm. Then, I fast for 16 hours until I start eating again the next day at 1pm.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, since I&#8217;ve started intermittent fasting I&#8217;ve increased muscle mass (up 10 pounds from 205 to 215), decreased body fat (down 3% from 14% to 11%), increased explosiveness (set a personal best with a clean and jerk of 253 pounds a few months back), and decreased the amount of time I&#8217;ve spent training (down from 7.5 hours per week to 2.5 hours per week).</p>
<p>In other words, I&#8217;m stronger, leaner, and more explosive even though I go to the gym less and eat less.</p>
<p>You may be wondering&#8230;</p>
<p>How is this possible? Isn&#8217;t skipping breakfast bad for you? Why would anyone fast for 16 hours every day? What are the benefits? Is there any science behind this or are you just crazy? Is it dangerous?</p>
<p>Slow down, friend. I&#8217;ve been known to do some crazy things, but this is totally legit. It&#8217;s easy to implement into your lifestyle and there are tons of health benefits. In this post, I&#8217;m going to break down intermittent fasting and everything that goes with it.</p>
<h2>What is Intermittent Fasting and Why Would You Do It?</h2>
<p>Intermittent fasting is not a diet, it&#8217;s a pattern of eating. It&#8217;s a way of scheduling your meals so that you get the most out of them. Intermittent fasting doesn’t change <em>what</em> you eat, it changes <em>when</em> you eat.</p>
<p>Why is it worthwhile to change when you’re eating?</p>
<p>Well, most notably, it’s a great way to get lean without going on a crazy diet or cutting your calories down to nothing. In fact, most of the time you&#8217;ll try to keep your calories the same when you start intermittent fasting. (Most people eat bigger meals during a shorter time frame.) Additionally, intermittent fasting is a good way to keep muscle mass on while getting lean.</p>
<p>With all that said, the main reason people try intermittent fasting is to lose fat. We&#8217;ll talk about how intermittent fasting leads to fat loss in a moment.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, intermittent fasting is one of the simplest strategies we have for taking bad weight off while keeping good weight on because it requires very little behavior change. This is a very good thing because it means intermittent fasting falls into the category of &#8220;simple enough that you&#8217;ll actually do it, but meaningful enough that it will actually make a difference.&#8221;</p>
<div class="adthrive_content_ad_horizontal"></div>
<h2>How Does Intermittent Fasting Work?</h2>
<p>To understand how intermittent fasting leads to fat loss we first need to understand the difference between the fed state and the fasted state.</p>
<p>Your body is in the fed state when it is digesting and absorbing food. Typically, the fed state starts when you begin eating and lasts for three to five hours as your body digests and absorbs the food you just ate. When you are in the fed state, it&#8217;s very hard for your body to burn fat because your insulin levels are high.</p>
<p>After that timespan, your body goes into what is known as the post–absorptive state, which is just a fancy way of saying that your body isn’t processing a meal. The post–absorptive state lasts until 8 to 12 hours after your last meal, which is when you enter the fasted state. It is much easier for you body to burn fat in the fasted state because your insulin levels are low.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re in the fasted state your body can burn fat that has been inaccessible during the fed state.</p>
<p>Because we don&#8217;t enter the fasted state until 12 hours after our last meal, it&#8217;s rare that our bodies are in this fat burning state. This is one of the reasons why many people who start intermittent fasting will lose fat without changing what they eat, how much they eat, or how often they exercise. Fasting puts your body in a fat burning state that you rarely make it to during a normal eating schedule.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p>Fat loss is great, but it isn&#8217;t the only benefit of fasting.</p>
<p><strong>1. Intermittent fasting makes your day simpler.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m big on behavior change, simplicity, and reducing stress. Intermittent fasting provides additional simplicity to my life that I really enjoy. When I wake up, I don&#8217;t worry about breakfast. I just grab a glass of water and start my day.</p>
<p>I enjoy eating and I don&#8217;t mind cooking, so eating three meals a day was never a hassle for me. However, intermittent fasting allows me to eat one less meal, which also means planning one less meal, cooking one less meal, and stressing about one less meal. It makes life a bit simpler and I like that.</p>
<p><strong>2. Intermittent fasting helps you live longer.</strong></p>
<p>Scientists have long known that restricting calories is a way of lengthening life. From a logical standpoint, this makes sense. When you’re starving, your body finds ways to extend your life.</p>
<p>There’s just one problem: who wants to starve themselves in the name of living longer?</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m interested in <em>enjoying</em> a long life. Starving myself doesn’t sound that appetizing.</p>
<p>The good news is that intermittent fasting activates many of the same mechanisms for extending life as calorie restriction. In other words, you get the benefits of a longer life without the hassle of starving.</p>
<p>Way back in 1945 it was discovered that intermittent fasting extended life in mice. (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/31/3/363.full.pdf">the study</a>.) More recently, <a href="http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(06)00089-2/abstract">this study</a> found that alternate day intermittent fasting led to longer lifespans.</p>
<p><strong>3. Intermittent fasting may reduce the risk of cancer.</strong></p>
<p>This one is up for debate because there hasn’t been a lot of research and experimentation done on the relationship between cancer and fasting. Early reports, however, look positive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2815756/">This study</a> of 10 cancer patients suggests that the side effects of chemotherapy may be diminished by fasting before treatment. This finding is also supported by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19135806">another study</a> which used alternate day fasting with cancer patients and concluded that fasting before chemotherapy would result in better cure rates and fewer deaths.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/86/1/7.full">this comprehensive analysis</a> of many studies on fasting and disease has concluded that fasting appears to not only reduce the risk of cancer, but also cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><strong>4. Intermittent fasting is much easier than dieting.</strong></p>
<p>The reason most diets fail isn’t because we switch to the wrong foods, it’s because we don’t actually follow the diet over the long term. It&#8217;s not a nutrition problem, it&#8217;s a behavior change problem.</p>
<p>This is where intermittent fasting shines because it&#8217;s remarkably easy to implement once you get over the idea that you need to eat all the time. For example, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20815899">this study</a> found that intermittent fasting was an effective strategy for weight loss in obese adults and concluded that &#8220;subjects quickly adapt&#8221; to an intermittent fasting routine.</p>
<p>I like the quote below from Dr. Michael Eades, who has tried intermittent fasting himself, on the difference between trying a diet and trying intermittent fasting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Diets are easy in the contemplation, difficult in the execution. Intermittent fasting is just the opposite — it’s difficult in the contemplation but easy in the execution.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Most of us have contemplated going on a diet. When we find a diet that appeals to us, it seems as if it will be a breeze to do. But when we get into the nitty gritty of it, it becomes tough. For example, I stay on a low–carb diet almost all the time. But if I think about going on a low–fat diet, it looks easy. I think about bagels, whole wheat bread and jelly, mashed potatoes, corn, bananas by the dozen, etc. — all of which sound appealing. But were I to embark on such a low–fat diet I would soon tire of it and wish I could have meat and eggs. So a diet is easy in contemplation, but not so easy in the long–term execution.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Intermittent fasting is hard in the contemplation, of that there is no doubt. “You go without food for 24 hours?” people would ask, incredulously when we explained what we were doing. “I could never do that.” But once started, it’s a snap. No worries about what and where to eat for one or two out of the three meals per day. It’s a great liberation. Your food expenditures plummet. And you’re not particularly hungry. &#8230; Although it’s tough to overcome the idea of going without food, once you begin the regimen, nothing could be easier.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>— Dr. Michael Eades</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, the ease of intermittent fasting is best reason to give it a try. It provides a wide range of health benefits without requiring a massive lifestyle change.</p>

<h2>Examples of Different Intermittent Fasting Schedules</h2>
<p>If you’re considering giving fasting a shot, there are a few different options for working it into your lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Intermittent Fasting</strong></p>
<p>Most of the time, I follow the Leangains model of intermittent fasting, which uses a 16–hour fast followed by an 8–hour eating period. This model of daily intermittent fasting was popularized by Martin Berkhan of <a href="http://leangains.com">Leangains.com</a>, which is where the name originated.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter when you start your 8–hour eating period. You can start at 8am and stop at 4pm. Or you start at 2pm and stop at 10pm. Do whatever works for you. I tend to find that eating around 1pm and 8pm works well because those times allow me to eat lunch and dinner with friends and family. Breakfast is typically a meal that I eat on my own, so skipping it isn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>
<p><img title="Leangains daily intermittent fasting" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Posts/leangains-daily-intermittent-fasting.jpg" alt="Leangains daily intermittent fasting" width="700" /></p>
<p>Because daily intermittent fasting is done every day it becomes very easy to get into the habit of eating on this schedule. Right now, you&#8217;re probably eating around the same time every day without thinking about it. Well, with daily intermittent fasting it&#8217;s the same thing, you just learn to not eat at certain times, which is remarkably easy.</p>
<p>One potential disadvantage of this schedule is that because you typically cut out a meal or two out of your day, it becomes more difficult to get the same number of calories in during the week. Put simply, it&#8217;s tough to teach yourself to eat bigger meals on a consistent basis. The result is that many people who try this style of intermittent fasting end up losing weight. That can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your goals.</p>
<p>This is probably a good time to mention that while I have practiced intermittent fasting consistently for the last year, I&#8217;m not fanatical about my diet. I work on building healthy habits that guide my behavior 90% of the time, so that I can do whatever I feel like during the other 10%. If I come over to your house to watch the football game and we order pizza at 11pm, guess what? I don&#8217;t care that it&#8217;s outside my feeding period, I&#8217;m eating it.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Intermittent Fasting</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to get started with intermittent fasting is to do it once per week or once per month. The occasional fast has been shown to lead to many of the benefits of fasting we&#8217;ve already talked about, so even if you don&#8217;t use it to cut down on calories consistently there are still many other health benefits of fasting.</p>
<p>The graphic below shows one example of how a weekly intermittent fast might play out.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Posts/weekly-intermittent-fasting.jpg" width="700" /></p>
<p>In this example, lunch on Monday is your last meal of the day. You then fast until lunch on Tuesday. This schedule has the advantage of allowing you to eat everyday of the week while still reaping the benefits of fasting for 24 hours. It&#8217;s also less likely that you&#8217;ll lose weight because you are only cutting out two meals per week. So, if you&#8217;re looking to bulk up or keep weight on, then this is a great option.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done 24–hour fasts in the past (I just did one last month) and there are a wide range of variations and options for making it work into your schedule. For example, a long day of travel or the day after a big holiday feast are often great times to throw in a 24–hour fast.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of doing a 24–hour fast is getting over the mental barrier of fasting. If you&#8217;ve never fasted before, successfully completing your first one helps you realize that you won&#8217;t die if you don&#8217;t eat for a day.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Day Intermittent Fasting</strong></p>
<p>Alternate day intermittent fasting incorporates longer fasting periods on alternating days throughout the week.</p>
<p>For example, in the graphic below you would eat dinner on Monday night and then not eat again until Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, however, you would eat all day and then start the 24–hour fasting cycle again after dinner on Wednesday evening. This allows you to get long fast periods on a consistent basis while also eating at least one meal every day of the week.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Posts/alternate-day-intermittent-fasting.jpg" width="700" /></p>
<p>This style of intermittent fasting seems to be used often in research studies, but from what I have seen it isn&#8217;t very popular in the real world. I&#8217;ve never tried alternate day fasting myself and I don&#8217;t plan to do so.</p>
<p>The benefit of alternate day intermittent fasting is that it gives you longer time in the fasted state than the Leangains style of fasting. Hypothetically, this would increase the benefits of fasting.</p>
<p>In practice, however, I would be concerned with eating enough. Based on my experience, teaching yourself to consistently eat more is one of the harder parts of intermittent fasting. You might be able to feast for a meal, but learning to do so every day of the week takes a little bit of planning, a lot of cooking, and consistent eating. The end result is that most people who try intermittent fasting end up losing some weight because the size of their meals remains similar even though a few meals are being cut out each week.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to lose weight, this isn&#8217;t a problem. And even if you&#8217;re happy with your weight, this won&#8217;t prove to be too much of an issue if you follow the daily fasting or weekly fasting schedules. However, if you&#8217;re fasting for 24 hours per day on multiple days per week, then it&#8217;s going to be very difficult to eat enough of your feast days to make up for that.</p>
<p>As a result, I think it&#8217;s a better idea to try daily intermittent fasting or a single 24–hour fast once per week or once per month.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions, Concerns, and Complaints</h2>
<p><strong>I’m a woman. Should I do anything differently?</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t worked with women on implementing an intermittent fasting schedule, so I can’t speak from experience on this one.</p>
<p>That said, I have heard that women may find a wider window of eating to be more favorable when doing daily intermittent fasting. While men will typically fast for 16 hours and then eat for 8 hours, women may find better results by eating for 10 hours and fasting for 14 hours. The best advice I can give anyone, not just women, is to experiment and see what works best for you. Your body will give you signals. Follow what your body responds favorably to.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re a female, there is an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FierceFitFearless?_rdr=p">all‐female page</a> on Facebook that discusses intermittent fasting. I’m sure you could find a ton of great answers and support there.</p>
<p><strong>I could never skip breakfast. How do you do it?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t. Breakfast foods are my favorite, so I just eat them at 1pm each day.</p>
<p>Also, if you eat a big dinner the night before, I think you’ll be surprised by how much energy you have in the morning. Most of the worries or concerns that people have about intermittent fasting are due to the fact that they have had it pounded into them by companies that they need to eat breakfast or they need to eat every three hours and so on. The science doesn’t support it and neither do my personal experiences.</p>
<p><strong>I thought you were supposed to eat every 3 hours?</strong></p>
<p>You may have heard people say that you should have six meals per day or eat every 3 hours or something like that.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why this was a popular idea for a brief period of time:</p>
<p>Your body burns calories when it&#8217;s processing food. So the thought behind the more meals strategy was that if you ate more frequently, you would also burn more calories throughout the day. Thus, eating more meals should help you lose weight.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem:</p>
<p>The amount of calories you burn is proportional to the size of the meal your body is processing. So, digesting six smaller meals that add up to 2000 calories burns the same amount of energy as processing two large meals of 1000 calories each.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you get your calories in 10 meals or in 1 meal, you&#8217;ll end up in the same place.</p>
<p><strong>This is crazy. If I didn&#8217;t eat for 24 hours, I&#8217;d die.</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I think the mental barrier is the biggest thing that prevents people from fasting because it&#8217;s really not that hard to do in practice.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why intermittent fasting isn&#8217;t as crazy as you think it is.</p>
<p>First, fasting has been practiced by various religious groups for centuries. Medical practitioners have also noted the health benefits of fasting for thousands of years. In other words, fasting isn&#8217;t some new fad or crazy marketing ploy. It&#8217;s been around for a long time and it actually works.</p>
<p>Second, fasting seems foreign to many of us simply because nobody talks about it that much. The reason for this is that nobody stands to make much money by telling you to not eat their products, not take their supplements, or not buy their goods. In other words, fasting isn&#8217;t a very marketable topic and so you&#8217;re not exposed to advertising and marketing on it very often. The result is that it seems somewhat extreme or strange, even though it&#8217;s really not.</p>
<p>Third, you&#8217;ve probably already fasted many times, even though you don&#8217;t know it. Have you ever slept in late on the weekends and then had a late brunch? Some people do this every weekend. In situations like these, we often eat dinner the night before and then don&#8217;t eat until 11am or noon or even later. There&#8217;s your 16–hour fast and you didn&#8217;t even think about it.</p>
<p>Finally, I would suggest doing one 24–hour fast even if you don&#8217;t plan on doing intermittent fasting frequently. It&#8217;s good to teach yourself that you&#8217;ll survive just fine without food for a day. Plus, as I&#8217;ve outlined with multiple research studies throughout this article, there are a lot of health benefits of fasting.</p>
<p><strong>What are some good resources on intermittent fasting?</strong></p>
<p>You can learn a lot about intermittent fasting by reading articles like this one and the resources below, but the best way to learn about what actually works for you is to experiment. That said, I&#8217;d recommend the following resources.</p>
<p>Martin Berkhan&#8217;s site on the Leangains version of intermittent fasting is great. You can find it <a href="http://leangains.com">here</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for a few articles to start with, I&#8217;d recommend <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/04/leangains-guide.html">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>Andy Morgan has also created an excellent site that covers the Leangains model of intermittent fasting, which you can <a href="https://rippedbody.com/">find here</a>. I particularly like his method of counting macros instead of counting calories, which you can read about <a href="https://rippedbody.com/how-to-count-macros/">here</a>. (That said, I don&#8217;t count anything. I just eat.)</p>
<p>There is a very active forum on Reddit where people post their own progress with the Leangains style of intermittent fasting. You can check that out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Brad Pilon wrote a good book on intermittent fasting called <em>Eat Stop Eat</em>, which you can buy <a href="http://www.eatstopeat.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, John Berardi&#8217;s report on intermittent fasting is a great example of testing the ideas in practice. You can <a href="http://www.precisionnutrition.com/intermittent-fasting">download it here</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s intermittent fasting in a nutshell.</p>
