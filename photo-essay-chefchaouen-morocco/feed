					<description><![CDATA[No wonder why this was your most popular photo essay this year - that village is so beautiful!

Looks like you had the same guide I had when I was there in 2012 - an elderly man with the coolest humor!

That was my best memory from Morocco - that and riding camels. ;-)]]></description>

Sounds like you had a great trip, Florin! I didn&#039;t get to see Essaouira, but I&#039;ve heard great things. (Guess I&#039;ll have to make a second trip!)

Thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice set of pictures James, I enjoyed them a lot!  Beautiful colours and compositions...

Only at the end of last week I have returned from a 8 day trip in Morocco myself, and although I have not visited Chefchaouen this time, the medinas in Rabat and Essaouira provided a somehow similar experience. Essaouira especially impressed me immensely, though we had only a 2-3 hours to visit it, from which 1 hour was a guided tour... I call it my dream town of Morocco, and I became very envious of its inhabitants.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,
Your photos are stunning!
I am enchanted with the very first one showing hills off in the distance. Is there a possibility that I could have your permission to paint that? My husband and I  are both artists in Alaska and I think your photo would have universal appeal.
feel free to see our website at
www.corneliusstudio.com

I-agree with the response of one of your writers,you should have a photo book made of that unique city!
Thank you for your sharing the gift of your photography,

Sincerely ,
Karen Cornelius]]></description>
