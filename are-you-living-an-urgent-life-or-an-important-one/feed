Ed -- I hear you. Handling responsibilities is tough and any goal worth pursuing will definitely take sacrifice. 

That said, there are ways to insulate yourself from the risk a little bit. When I started out as an entrepreneur, I had a 6-month safety net built up to give myself a little runway. I started a business with very low overhead. And in your case, you could moonlight on the side for awhile and build up a few clients, just to prove that it&#039;s possible before making the leap.

In any case, believe in yourself and good luck!]]></description>

JennEva -- very good point. It all starts with identity and your belief in yourself.

I wrote more about that in this article (you might find it useful): https://jamesclear.vercel.app/identity-based-habits

Thanks for reading! It&#039;s great to have you in our little community!]]></description>

Yep -- this is a big lesson that I had to learn as well. Blocking off time to commit to yourself (just like you would when meeting with someone else) is a huge skill to learn. This is especially true if you&#039;re self-employed or have a lot of freedom on your job.

Thanks for reading, Tibor! It&#039;s great to have you in our little community!]]></description>

So true. I&#039;m the same way. I need a single-task focus and my results are much better. (Example: I&#039;ve spent the last two hours answering comments.)

Hi Ed!
There can be other ways to take actions than make your dream into your first job at once. For example, have you considered the possibility of a side job? I&#039;m sure there are other possibilities too, maybe you should take some time to think about it, so that you don&#039;t give up your dreams too soon :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice idea to follow one&#039;s goals...but....

I want to go freelance, but I have to consider my family.  For example, if I finish one contract, my wife would be worrying that I won&#039;t get another one for ages.  Also I might have to work away from home.  So for now I&#039;m stuck with a mediocre job that just pays my wages but doesn&#039;t really offer any promise of independence etc.]]></description>
