					<description><![CDATA[James and I love your newsletters... they are so meaningful and easy to apply!

These Lines:

&quot;Most of the time, I think our constant quest to achieve faster results is a trap.&quot;

&quot;We get so obsessed on the goal that we forget that the system is what matters. We get so obsessed with the outcome that we overlook the repetitions we need to do to get there. We become so focused on the short-term results that we forget to build the long-term habits that make the real difference.&quot;

So correct.

P.S. I read somewhere that you are going to publish a book compiling all your newsletters and ideas... Please inform me when it is out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James :)

I found the part in your last article about altering your behaviour with immediate feedback very interesting. I can see it being highly effective.

Do you think immediate feedback could be used to alter another persons behaviour. I imagine it could?

A personal problem I would love to solve is being able to communicate with my daughters father without being emotionally or verbally abused. He will only communicate via text message or phone call. I know that the responses I give somewhat affect his behaviour and therefore as a result of my actions the abuse is now very minimal. But it&#039;s still there. The main thing was to reduce communication to almost none. But as our daughter is only 2 years old there are a lot of things that should be being communicated and they are not (eg medical, toilet training, routines, contact details etc). 

Your article makes me wonder if there are immediate responses I can give that will in time alter his behaviour.

Anyway. Very interesting, and food for thought, so thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The world around us shapes our behavior&quot;

Don&#039;t really know if this is true. I&#039;m certain it affects us severely in the long-term but can&#039;t we build up a certain level of resistance to others to block out their activities and override ours?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of current feedback and one percent improvement. I have started to do only 5 minutes of easy movement every day. No major strain on the body. Just to establish the habit. Then improve on the type of exercise.  But it is a start. I am giving more thought to how my home is set up to support what I want to accomplish. Thanks for your effort.]]></description>
