					<description><![CDATA[This is a really useful, however I&#039;ve found that, even though I&#039;m a practitioner of this very technique, that life can get to a point where you start getting into your sleep time.  You usually can&#039;t say I will just sleep later.  That&#039;s how we get locked into a cycle that eventually takes our health down because sleep deprivation will (trust me!) catch up with you.

I&#039;m still trying to figure out how to deal with that.  I&#039;ve already cut out all the non-essentials and there still aren&#039;t enough hours in the day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James -- I love your positive and inspirational blog posts, but PLEASE do not rely on spelling/grammar checkers.

In the last line of the last paragraph you wrote &quot;...saying on-task...&quot; Your spell/grammar checker either changed this from what you intended it to read or you mistyped it and the spell checker assumed it to be correct.

Thank you and keep the inspiration coming.

					<description><![CDATA[Great write up James. The If-Then technique has worked wonders for me too. I&#039;ve resorted to caring around a tiny notebook in my back pocket and often write down my if-thens in it as they come. At the end of the day I&#039;ll review it as a way to have it all sink in.

Thanks for the great writeup.

With gratitude,

Justin]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true. I have a day job where little things crop up that get in the way of well-timed day. Emergencies during lunch break, late meetings, early meetings, etc. Just getting my one post per week done on Fridays can be a challenge because of schedule fluidity. Usually, planning for chaos means staying up later or getting up earlier - both of which are OK. I have learned that keeping my own schedule fluid is the only way to combat it.]]></description>
