Scared takes us all at times Jen. I&#039;m in my 60s and recently got my driver&#039;s license (on a manual). Still scared when I go out but also pleased with my progress.

Confidence will build with practice. Best of luck with your blog, I look forward to reading it as I also like organic gardening/sustainability.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/keystrokes#comment-11851&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

It more than helps, James.  I understand just what you meant, and I am fascinated by the role of context in communication. It&#039;s my almost metaphysical belief that facts have no meaning without a context, and that context arises from otherwise meaningless facts. 

While what you say about your words on the internet being read in other times and places - hence other contexts - is interesting in itself, perhaps the way you most profoundly lead at scale is by altering those other contexts 

Thank you for the explanation, and the interesting idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/keystrokes#comment-11821&quot;&gt;Michael Jones&lt;/a&gt;.

Good question, Michael. There isn&#039;t any great mystery behind the phrase (at least not in the context I used it). Most leadership environments are small and contained. For example, if you&#039;re a leader on a team or in a family or an organization, your leadership abilities are often confined to the time and space you share with those people.

Writing, however, is a way to scale your ideas and spread your leadership around regardless of time and context. This is especially true on the internet. You&#039;re reading this article now even though I wrote it a long time ago. You&#039;re reading it in a very different place than where I wrote it. Probably a place that I have never visited. I don&#039;t need to be present to display leadership through writing. The words are here for others to read and digest and use regardless of when or where they come from. In other words, my &quot;leadership&quot; scales to different times and places through writing. This isn&#039;t something that happens in a face-to-face context. That is what I meant when I said that writing was leading at scale.

Hope that helps! Thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article and good point, I get it--we will be happier, healthier, and wealthier if we work to make our work count.  HOWEVER, I disagree that we only have so many keystrokes left.  Like exercise making our muscles stronger, using our keyboards strengthens our fingers and our creative muscles and minds, allowing them to create longer and better.

I almost always feel like writing.  There is so much value in the crappy first draft--which is almost always better than we thought it would be before we started.]]></description>

Thanks for the refocus.  Glimpse into a future world where time is the currency and watch the 2011 pop culture movie &quot;In Time.&quot; I&#039;m not a Justin Timberlake fan or a pop culture groupie....for once, my teenage nephew picked a good little movie.

Time is the new poverty. We need to keep focusing employers on quality of work, not quantity of work..... the next generation will achieve work-life balance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

Enjoyed the article.  The keystrokes idea reminded me of a post I saw recently that explained how parents have something like 940 Saturdays with their kids before they turn 18.  As a new parent it just made me think about how to make all of those Saturdays count.

I got the same inspiration from your post, that we need to make those keystrokes (moments) count.

Tim Ferriss had Kevin Kelly on his podcast and Kelly said he went as far as to look up his expected life span in actuarial tables and put a count down clock on his computer to show him in real time how much time he had left.  Kind of extreme, but a good reminder that every second/minute/hour/day/keystroke counts.]]></description>
