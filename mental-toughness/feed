					<description><![CDATA[One of my favorite posts ever! Definitely something that I struggle with and intend working on in 2015. To me, it&#039;s also about doing what I said I would do, and keeping my promises to myself.

&quot;Mental toughness comes down to your habits. It’s about doing the things you know you’re supposed to do on a more consistent basis. It’s about your dedication to daily practice and your ability to stick to a schedule.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t have never will.  No matter how hard I try I always walk away when things get tough.  No matter what routine I try at the gym, new work project, etc.  I always give up.  This may work for some but not for me.  I have proven it to myself enough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, this seems to be one of those articles, that do more to you than just inspiring and motivating. The best part about the article is that it brings you back to a reality which seems a bit forgotten, but it gives you the tools and makes you realise that no matter what, we all can. 

Well, I am 21. Currently, I am at a position, where I am actually waking up to realize my calling and preparing to go for it. After reading this, I do plan to be consistent and raise the power of my grit, with practice.

There is one question however... Say, a person knows what he or she wants to excel in, but what if a pathological/ inherent need to be heard, appreciated or simply to be known is also tied to it? What if both excellence and fame are priorities? Would concentrating on fame over here, act as a negative catalyst? Would doing that be somewhat similar to focusing on the performance, rather on practice? If yes, then how should a person try to differentiate between the two and work on them individually? If no, then should modifications be made in the tactics mentioned above, to associate them together and work towards the united dream? 

I know, I might be less mature than most of my friends over here...  but, it&#039;s never too early to be clearer about things that matter to an individual.

Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another Inspiring article, James. I LOVE it! I have made &quot;Sisu&quot; my new focus word.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you James for another inspiring article. This post came at a right time for me and I finally understand what mental toughness means. 

Thank you for letting me know that it is OK to not be perfect (in everything I do) as long as you persevere in maintaining certain form of small scale habits.

I find it to be similar to your example of eating processed food. When I stop eating processed food for 1 day, I will work harder to ensure that this continues the next day and the day after. Until I achieve a 7 day goal. Will attempt to try that on myself. I have tried so previously, but I haven&#039;t been consistent. 

I have also been working to quit coffee for more than half a year. But of late, I picked up coffee drinking again to test and observe on whether I can still tolerate caffeine. The first time, it was OK. I felt more energized and healthy. And then, the second and third time occurred (weeks later), and it is all back to square one. I am determined to give up coffee for good but I won&#039;t do it so drastically. I am currently switching to tea and hopefully slowly reducing them until it become like &#039;leisure drinking&#039; kind of thing. 

I really hope this kind of small ways in pushing myself for both caffeine drinking and processed food consumption will help me to develop the mental toughness as you described. And also in other areas of my life. 

Will definitely keep reading (or reread) all of your posts to help to motivate myself! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks James.

I was a professional tennis player and I can definitely agree with the fact that talent is worthless unless you have grit and determination. I was a very talented tennis player, but in the end I just wasn&#039;t mentally tough enough to take that next step in my career while I saw so many others who were less talented than me succeed.

It was a life changing experience for me though, and I have tried to apply what let me down in my tennis career in every other area of my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I love what you say about mental toughness. Ultimately I think it is the characteristic that separates the winners from everyone else. I love two aspects in particular that you say: 

1. Mentally tough people don’t have to be more courageous, more talented, or more intelligent — just more consistent. 
2. You can&#039;t think you way to be mentally tough - you can only act your way into doing so. 

I&#039;d say that so many of the challenges we face would dissipate if we could only work on our mental toughness.

Thank you for sharing,

Niro]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a well-written article! My middle school-aged son is an athlete, and he recently asked me how he can develop more mental toughness. This article was the first one I clicked on when I googled a search for developing mental toughness. There is NO magic bullet, and this article beautifully explains how grit, consistency, and hard work are the keys to success. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this subject. Very helpful indeed!]]></description>
