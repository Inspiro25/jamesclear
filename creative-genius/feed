					<description><![CDATA[Great article. 

I have been struggling with my meditation for years, not showing up for it and waiting for inspiration (which never comes)!

The advice I was given when I started was &quot;Focus on the effort, not the results.&quot; A mirror of what your article is saying. 

Thank You, for reminding of this piece of advice. Perhaps I should go buy a new pair of  trainers and Just do it! 

Regards,

Richard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! I definitely need it tonight. I&#039;m halfway through a book I&#039;m writing, and I&#039;m struggling with part of it. Very inspirational. I like the Anne Lamott quote.

By the way, I&#039;ve also heard that it takes about ten years of regular play for chess players to become masters and grandmasters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

Subscribed to your newsletter recently and the &#039;Transform your Habits&#039; booklet is simply awesome. Thank you for sharing.

I&#039;d love it if you could write on &#039;How to find your true calling/ Purpose / Passion&#039;. Although a lot of stuff I read tells me to just try a volume of things and strike gold at one. Then there are ones by Paul Graham like this one citing more options http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html

However, I&#039;d like to hear if you have anything else to offer from your experience/reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

This concept is so true- just finish the work!  I am a quilter and now I make myslef finish all my quilts, right to the end, as otherwise it&#039;s just a scrap of fabric!  And I loved the comment at the end regarding showing people your work, as in that split second before they comment, you have your answer if you look. I&#039;m going to study that further!
