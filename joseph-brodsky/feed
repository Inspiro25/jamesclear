					<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;m somewhat opposite.  If someone directly criticizes something I&#039;m working on - be it housework or graphic design or personal fashion - I&#039;m more likely to work against them MORE.  If they hadn&#039;t said anything, then I&#039;ll just chug along until I get bored or distracted.  

But if someone says, &quot;I hate the way you ____, and you shouldn&#039;t do that,&quot; I immediately go into &quot;Oh YEAH!!  Well, I&#039;ll show YOU!!!&quot; mode.  (My entire family is like this.  If we&#039;re left alone, we just sort of vegetate.  If we get insulted or harshly criticized, we go into extreme &quot;Watch me as I SOAR!!&quot; mode.  lol )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE THIS!!  And I think it would please angels as well,  because the only person we should share our negatives with (&#039;cause He&#039;s the only one who REALLY cares!) is God!  And even then we need to remember that there is more benefit in praise than complaining.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, 

Great article as ever. However I disagree with your comment about criticism of science. Criticism is a very important part of the scientific process. Good science is subject to criticism at all stages of the process, from conception of the idea, planning of the experiment, competing for funding, data analysis and interpretation, writing of the manuscript, and finally editorial review. Rigorous criticism gives the consumer of science some measure of confidence in its quality.]]></description>

I know exactly what you&#039;re getting at, as I thought of whistleblowers shedding light on evildoers, and therefore successfully shutting it down.  

Looking at the context of Brodsky&#039;s particular words above, though, I think he was taking what he learned about oppressors, and what he learned about returning to life again, to address graduating college kids.  Since he was telling them explicitly how to deal with the more (likely) negative characters in their upcoming lives, how not to let them steal space in one&#039;s brain, I think he really was teaching what James Clear is indicating he was.  I&#039;m pretty sure he was not preparing them all to deal with a superpower, but how to LIVE after having been oppressed and lost something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved this article. I agree totally with spending your time on positive thoughts and actions. This is a very timely reminder and wise advice for those who struggle with unjust accusations. This is a keeper.

That said, I believe there is a place for public airing of harmful actions by the government or organizations, such as whistleblowing. 

Thanks so much for a very different view of dealing with detractors in our lives.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James! This was an amazing story and a great post. I work with people and their finances, and sometimes those negative thoughts and feelings about what they&#039;ve done &quot;wrong&quot; seem so large that they are like quicksand, even if they are doing some stuff right. I especially loved this point and I think you really captured it well: &quot;The impact of negativity is magnified when we talk about it, no matter what we say. We breathe life into poor decisions, bad ideas, and evil people by discussing them over and over again.&quot;]]></description>

Hi James, another small correction - I think his original partner was Marina, not Maria... (Maria was his wife later on).]]></description>
