					<description><![CDATA[Incredible post! Also, good point about setting a schedule rather than a deadline. What may work for others may not work for you so do what&#039;s best for you. Anyways thanks for this awesome blog post! I wrote a similar post on my blog about how anyone can achieve their goals but your post is simply simplistic but effective. Thanks again!]]></description>

Fair point Ramon. I could have worded that better. And I definitely agree that habits are what take us to our goals. Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post. I believe you&#039;re mixing goals and habits. Habits are all about schedules. Good habits lead you to reaching your goals and preserving the benefits of achieving them. Besides, we are really poor at estimating when and what we might achieving from following a certain strategy for the first time. I am definitely for forming and sticking with good habits.
Peace]]></description>
