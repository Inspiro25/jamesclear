					<description><![CDATA[This article made me realize I use the term &quot;I can&#039;t&quot; way too often. From here on I will choose &quot;I don&#039;t&quot;. Thanks for the advice. I believe this information will be a big help in my situation.

Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know how obvious this is, but I never thought about what I think. I just think about the action or I don&#039;t, usually when I give in to temptation my head is blank and I&#039;m watching my body very vividly.

This is really weird and is giving me a better way to look at what I&#039;m doing. Thanks for the article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with Eric &quot;Wow, Great timing.&quot; I replaced my coffee with my healthy coffee and have lost 83 pounds, since the beginning of June, as of last week November 5th. It has been fun too.  I agree that what you say is important. I don&#039;t eat breads, pastas, fried foods, or desserts. When people ask if it&#039;s hard, I say, &quot; it&#039;s easy!&quot; If I have a taste for something sweet I drink my hot chocolate or mocha. Thank you James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just came across you via the toobs yesterday, and now devouring your words James.

But as Ginny commented, sometimes you just have to subvert the stubborn, contrarian brain by other means, so mine will be &quot;DON&#039;T say CAN&#039;T or you WON&#039;T.

Hopefully, that&#039;ll do the trick when simply saying don&#039;t, won&#039;t do. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t spend money friviolously. I don&#039;t eat junk food. I don&#039;t miss workouts. 

This would be great paired with the self affirmation and self belief concept that you&#039;ve blogged about. 

&quot;I don&#039;t eat junk food because I&#039;m the type of person who is really healthy&quot;; &quot;I don&#039;t spend money friviolously becuase I am the type of person who spends money in line with my values&quot;; &quot;I don&#039;t miss workouts because I&#039;m the type of person who is strong, fit, and takes health seriously&quot;. 

Do you just tell yourself these things, or do you write it down, or how do you really drill it into your own head?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow this is truly amazing James! There&#039;s really a clear distinction between both statements.

This is my first time commenting on your blog. I&#039;ve stumbled upon your blog from BufferApp blog and been reading your posts every.single.day and this post really amazed me.

Keep up the good work James! And like many readers from your blog, I&#039;m also give your updates a special place in my Inbox, labelled &quot;James Clear Awesomeness.&quot;

P.S. - I am a reader from Malaysia :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, James.  I love the distinction between &quot;I don&#039;t&quot; and &quot;I can&#039;t&quot;.  It marks such a huge difference in a person&#039;s perspective to be able to make healthy choices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your articles, and really love how you incorporate &quot;how to apply this in real life&quot; ... it makes it that much personal. :)

					<description><![CDATA[I wish I had read this article just 15 minutes ago before I went and ate a cookie I didn&#039;t even really want!

I will make sure to start using this method right away though, rather than always saying I&#039;ll do it tomorrow!!

Thanks for your advice!! :)]]></description>
