					<description><![CDATA[Great post!

Question for you: I work at a company that serves meals and snacks, most of which are cookies, candies, etc. Any advice for how to change your environment when you actually can&#039;t change your environment?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very informative! Thanks for the new outlook: Architecture Willpower.  I always looked upon it as something that certain people had more of.  But in the end, it all depends on how we use our willpower, and of course, our environment.  Surround yourself with greatness!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this great article James.

I completely agree that when you’re surrounded by better choices, it’s a lot easier to make a good one.  

If you can share other ways we can use choice architecture to design our choices, it would be great help for me.

Thx,
Skillz]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

Great post!  Three books that touch on similar ideas are &quot;Eat Move Sleep&quot; by Tom Rath (just finished it and loved it), &quot;Salt Sugar Fat&quot; by Michael Moss and &quot;Mindless Eating&quot; by Brian Wansink.

Keep up the great work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/choice-architecture#comment-7575&quot;&gt;Rok Sprogar&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;ve got a point. Most of the change was due to persuasion (phase I) and not to choice architecture. They delivered information, had a dietitian available for two weeks, even produced some kind of information for people to take (leaflets?) and cued buyers using a familiar colour coding. &quot;Choice architecture&quot; had a smaller effect on choices and even some adverse reactions (&quot;don&#039;t you try to tell me what to buy!&quot;) 

The reason why we hear about sodas is because they were able to cherry pick their numbers afterwards, and in that sense their study is very thorough. It would only make sense to talk about sodas if the intervention was solely aimed at getting people to drink better. But it wasn&#039;t.

I&#039;m also not sure you can apply these findings to readers of this blog: we are all somehow motivated, we all have information and most of us have the ability to consciously influence our environment - unlike the subjects in this study. When we learn to use these at the right moment - when making choices at the supermarket, for example, we don&#039;t really need to use much willpower at home. In short, I agree with James conclusions but disagree with the premises of this article.]]></description>
