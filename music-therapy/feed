					<description><![CDATA[Even Bible says:

Saul was filled with grief and trouble, and he became melancholy. Then David took an harp, and played with his hands; at the same time sung hymns and psalms; made use both of vocal and instrumental music. Saul was refreshed, and was well; became cheerful, his grief was removed, his black and gloomy apprehensions of things were dispersed, and he was cured of his melancholy disorder for the present and the evil spirit departed from him: at least for a while; he had his fits and intervals; of the effects of music in a natural way;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are a number of randomized and controlled trials researching the effects of music with clinical populations that have clearly defined as active vs passive or listening vs live. Furthermore, there are a number of meta-analyses of the existing research that use accepted forms of statistical analysis to examine the effects of music - these are able to look at larger numbers due to combining studies. &quot;Large&quot; numbers in trials are problematic due to the nature of the populations i.e. medical studies also struggle to get &quot;large&quot; numbers in complex populations, and it is typically complex populations with music therapy is used as a clinical intervention. Do examine the best evidence about music therapy and music medicine research, you need to look at the Cochrane Library. http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/view/0/index.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I am a registered music therapist from New Zealand. I would suggest the author do a through literature search on music therapy as most the research questions asked have already been answered in music therapy research.

The music therapy Cochrane Reviews are a good place to start:

Interesting. Do you have any links to these studies? Or suggestions of journals that frequently publish research from Certified Clinical Musicians and Music Therapists?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post.  As I read, what struck me was the use of music as a creative outlet for therapy or serenity. My question is whether this works for nonmusically inclined people. I like to listen to music, but not with any sense of need. I can be happy with silence or the sounds of nature.  For me, words are my way out of tangled troubles.  Writing out my thoughts, writing a letter, an essay, even a text or email to a friend can help.  Reading is also a way to lose myself, but that is more escapist and doesn&#039;t tend to resolve things.  Talking with a true friend is very very helpful, but having a true friend to be open with is also very rare for me.  Music, for my soul&#039;s healing, is a caring friend and words.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After all, what is said on the subject of &#039;music therapy&#039; -- either listening to it or participating in a music programme, it cannot be disputed that music, heals and calms the mind and in turn, accelerates recovery from health issues. Most of us are fond of music, in some form or other and do we not attend to music performances which gives us pleasure, is it not? Pleasure and in turn, happiness promotes health.]]></description>
