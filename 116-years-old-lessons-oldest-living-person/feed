James,

Your counter argument / point is spot on. Standing up for what we believe in isn&#039;t considered butting in, unless it&#039;s intrusive and we&#039;re forcing thoughts down someones throat. The key is that we mind our own business for the petty, unimportant, non goal oriented activities. This can be better known as gossip or irrelevant situations to your life goals. Life goals can take many forms so it&#039;s up to you to decide whats what.]]></description>

The world wouldn&#039;t be a better place without Martin Luther Kings or other positive engagements. But I guess if really everybody who had or has any kind of impact on the world would have minded his own business, the world wouldn&#039;t necessarily be much worse. Unfortunately by far most of the human impact has been negative. And where&#039;s a lot of minus it takes an even bigger plus to improve something...]]></description>
