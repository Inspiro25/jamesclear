					<description><![CDATA[Hi James. Thanks for this post, it carries a theme that relates to my approach to many things... spending too much effort on the final product, to perfect it before anyone else has a chance to see it.

From 2007 to 2012 I spent nearly 5 years writing one book. I rewrote each chapter at least four times, perfecting it before anyone had a chance to read it. I wrote so much that it is now being released as kindle ebooks. Meanwhile a lot of other people have written ten times as much in the time it took me to complete my &quot;masterpiece.&quot; And in the end, I did not complete a masterpiece or a work of &quot;perfect art&quot;.

My goal for this year is to focus on the reps and not the outcomes. To produce the quantity that will eventually turn out the quality.

Thanks for this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, I am really enjoying your articles.

You are a very talented writer with a rare skill to bring the essentials to the front in a logical and entertaining way.

I have to agree with you about the magic of repetition because it is the basis of habits but habits can be good and bad. I believe that was Nathaniel Emmons who said that &quot;Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters&quot;. The danger of blind repetition is that it can enforce bad habits and bad habits are very difficult to erase.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I work on a Mental Health Unit and since starting recently reading your articles I have found so much that can be relayed to the patients to aid recovery and to show them a way to achieve a little piece of mind in their every day needs... It&#039;s been really helpful, and I can&#039;t see the reason why so many people won&#039;t share this information without putting a financially huge cost.

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really liked this article, James!

I&#039;ve been always told and have always believed quality over quantity but never really realized that in order to get QUALITY you have to repeatedly do something MANY TIMES (quantity).  I create Alternative Hip Hop instrumentals but decided last year that I should try songwriting and actually go through the motions of creating a 5 track EP and go through songwriting, beat production, mixing, recording and mastering all by myself. It took me 9 months but the product ended up the 5 track EP but MOST IMPORTANTLY, was that I was able to touch on each aspect of the process to make a group of songs.  More recently, I decided to make another EP from scratch and when I began I usually begin with the music (instrumental) so I sat down and decided &quot;I&#039;m going to make an EPIC instrumental&quot; and I sat there and fiddled and nothing.  Few weeks later I sat down and I remembered a melody that came to me and I started playing around with that, and about 2 hours later, I had something simple that actually sounded pretty good and was getting great feedback from my friends.  

This felt like this definitely applied to this article as well to not worry about &quot;perfection&quot; and instead just put out ideas and see what comes about.  I was too focus on creating something GOOD as opposed to just creating SOMETHING.  You&#039;re articles have definitely helped me out in the way I think about the work I do.

Keep up the great work and thanks!  Oh, and I&#039;ve been passing along these articles to my friends. :)

					<description><![CDATA[Love this.

I&#039;m a percussion performance major in college. My favorite instrument is marimba and a very inspiring figure in the marimba world named Nancy Zeltsman speaks often about how the only way to get better is to play a LOT of music. Rather than perfecting and memorizing three pieces, why not also learn 10 while reading off the page? That mass of experience results in awesome gains. I&#039;m also working to perform MORE. Accompanying musicians, composition recitals, small ensembles. The more times I get under the lights the better of a performer I will be. Two perfect performances aren&#039;t worth as much as 10 good ones. 

That&#039;s my take on this article from the music world.]]></description>
