					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,
I, too, struggle with some of these issues.  I invite you to read a book entitled &#039;Do Not Fear!&#039; (An analysis of the worst of emotions)  It is by a Jesuit priest, who spent many years as a missionary priest in India.  Author: Carlos G. Valles, S.J.  I am simply passing this info along to you.  The present Pope has read some of his books, therefore if some of his writings are good enough for Pope Francis they ought to be good enough for us and anyone else interested.
Wishing you blessings in 2015.
P.E.L]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s so much in that that gives me the creeps. I find when I tackle big projects I spend all my time reviewing my plan , so I completely understand where you&#039;re coming from. I had the same issue when I tried to plan a career change 12 years ago. My biggest problem was recognising mistakes and creating a better plan without fuss, so I&#039;m going to keep a close eye on you next year.

I enjoy reading articles from thought leaders and enjoy yours because I find it easy to understand what you say and you don&#039;t use big words.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I lack self belief and confidence I am writing my first novel and have written it over and over in my head to the  point of knowing every detail of the characters I&#039;ve created yet I&#039;m having such a hard time believing I can really do this.  Is it just a dream? I have no support from anyone.  Superficial friends love my ideas but when I&#039;m left alone the negative demons get their way. Chewing my confidence until all I have left is doubts. You&#039;re going to fail. You won&#039;t get it finished.  So then the frustration takes over and I fall down a great big hole. Depression. A place all to familiar where I&#039;ve wasted so much of my life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve struggled with this issue for quite some time. It began as kind of a lazy&#039;s getaway but it turned into a real problem when I failed to deliver to professors and bosses. So I took the most scientific approach I could. 

Everything that could be reduced to a basic component, should. All of those basic components, which I call nodes btw, should be taken one by one on a timely basis. By timely I mean that rather than saying I have to get done some X number of nodes, you should think in rates. I have to get 2 nodes done per day, for example. I personally like to use a graphical way of picturing it, since often seeing is believing. So in working graphically I&#039;d start with the final product at the very top and keep reducing it into it&#039;s simpler components until those components aren&#039;t reducible anymore. It should look like a Christmas tree, mathematically those are known as ordered trees.

So, applying my approach to your big project I&#039;d say the principal node would be your book. First order nodes would be the chapters of your book. Within each chapter you might have sections, which would be second order nodes. Each section is made up by shorter passages, which would be third order nodes. And then each passage is made up by paragraphs, or fourth order nodes. Each paragraph is made up by sentences, fifth order nodes. And finally, each sentence is made up by words, or constitutive nodes. 

You start the constitutive nodes and work your way into the principal node and, even though you might not accelerate the rate at which you write the words, you might save time by always knowing where you are and where your destination is. And more importantly, what do you have to do to get to your goal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great name for this very real syndrome and a good article. 

May I share a strategy that I have used with success? It is from a book called &quot;How to Grow a Business&quot;. In a section about &quot;tackling a major task&quot;, the authors recommend the following (paraphrased): 

Do SOMETHING toward a goal (and it can be almost anything, as long as it&#039;s DOING) to help snap you out of procrastination and back into activity. DON&#039;T FRET over whether you&#039;re doing the RIGHT thing: JUST GET STARTED! 

To this I would add: Repeat as necessary until you have overcome that &quot;starting resistance&quot;. You will soon have the momentum to propel you forward to accomplish a significant portion of the task.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

Your post made me smile. How about you take half an hour and outline to yourself how the book fits in to your life? I have read a total of three of your blog posts, and they all seem to focus on tweaking little things to have bigger and better impact on your (or your readers&#039;) life(s). 

My guess is that the book you are currently writing, is only a part of a bigger picture or system; a system of your believes, your writing, public speaking, your readers, sales..how you want to spend your life, your time at work, your time off work. 

Objectively, if you have a fair bit of potential sales already &quot;in the bag&quot; - which seems to be the case - you will be commissioned to write more books. Publishing houses like sales.  

Therefore, your first book is only a small part of your career as a published writer. And you will be able to apply your own methods on this small part of your life. And you no longer have the need for perfection or cramming it all in - because you can stick some of that stuff into the next book. 

The other thing that works (in addition to changing your mindset as above) is to get a trusted person with reading skills to review your manuscript thus far. It is important that the person is also brutally blunt and honest. You probably have someone like that around. 

Sometimes just changing the order of chapters or a comment &quot;more on this&quot; or &quot;this is dull as anything, cut it out&quot; is enough to break the spell of a blocked mind. 

Good luck. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lots of good info posted above and hopefully it will help. 

I am currently faced with a very big and financially important project as well. Reading this hit home on a few levels about knowing you can do it but your not sure why it isn&#039;t happening was the same for me. 

I needed to get back to my old way of figuring myself out. Which for me is to spend a quiet session(s) of asking myself &quot;why&quot; am I behaving in this manner. Then think about that answer for a bit and ask yourself &quot;why&quot; again. This will be repeated maybe 4-7 times until I feel I understand the deeper meaning of my behavior via my subconscious thoughts. 

It is very easy to fool and ignore our inner thoughts by busying the ever present logical mind with action. If you want to truly understand your reason(s) then spend some time getting to know yourself. The clarity from this exercise will be all you need to either move forward or rethink your underlying motivation.]]></description>
