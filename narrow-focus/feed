					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/narrow-focus#comment-10434&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;.

@Martin - A small solution to stop smoking would be to try to postpone smoking a cigarette for 5 minutes ...then 10 minutes ... then 15 minutes.

Another small solution would be to eliminate just 1 cigarette from your day.

That&#039;s my opinion of how to apply the &#039;small solutions&#039; method James describes in this article. That being said, I smoked for about 15 years and made many attempts to quit. Ultimately, I had to get truly mad (think visceral) and quit cold turkey. I hope that the &#039;small solution&#039; method works for you, but if it doesn&#039;t, I hope that you will find something else that is effective for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

It was heartening to know about your sister&#039;s fight with cancer and her eventual victory. I think this was the first time you shared something so deeply personal on such a platform. (Or the first time I read about it.) It requires great courage to do so, in my opinion.

Thanks for making me (us) a part of your journey.

God bless!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a cancer survivor myself (Breast not leukemia), thank you Dr. Farber, for starting small. 

What an important insight! Being an &quot;idea&quot; person, I struggle with bringing them to fruition. The only way is to start small. I have a particular issue I am dealing with right now, and what a perfect reminder! 

Thank you James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I know you&#039;re not a guru, but I&#039;m wondering how your start small strategy (which I strongly agree with) might apply to a person who wants to lose weight.

Best regards,
Michael Morris

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/narrow-focus#comment-10434&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;.

I had smoked on and off for most of my life, stopping for a few years in my late 30s and early 40s when I ran marathons. Smoked 10 or less a day for years afterwards then switched to a few cigars.

Never able to completely stop despite trying many methods, I eventually found the motivation.

At age 60, I survived a heart attack. I lay on the table with a catheter the size of a pen in my groin, looking at the extent of the damage to my heart on a computer monitor.

The cardiologist calmly said I was lucky to have survived and suggested it might be a good time to give up smoking permanently.

I did. Have not had the slightest urge to start again for 4 years.

Given sufficient motivation quitting is easy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/narrow-focus#comment-10451&quot;&gt;Isabel Price&lt;/a&gt;.

I used the Allen Carr &quot;Easy Way&quot; method. I haven&#039;t had a cig since June 26, 2009. 

The first couple 2 weeks suck. But after that, it gets much, much easier.]]></description>
