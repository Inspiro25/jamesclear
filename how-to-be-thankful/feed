					<description><![CDATA[I blew through the first part of this article because I HAD TO GET THROUGH my emails. I was going quickly. QUICK, what&#039;s the gist? I HAVE TO get through these an on to my other tasks. 
And then I saw your one word: get, get to, I get to do these things. 
Everything stopped. 
You&#039;re right James. You&#039;ve just changed my day. And my attitude. 
Thank you. 
And, I&#039;m so glad I get to read what you write 2ce weekly. : ))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always a JOY to read your posts! I was just making a list of all the things I&#039;m intended to release from my life. As I completed my first round I read your blog. Found myself really excited about all I &quot;get&quot; to do, rather than what I &quot;have&quot; to do. Total energy shift!

Thanks a million.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoy your posts every week, even it has become one of my daily duties to open the email and read them in the two days.

You are a highly encouraging person. Thank you so much for your inspiring words all the time.

Thanks again, James!

Sincerely,
Khadra]]></description>
