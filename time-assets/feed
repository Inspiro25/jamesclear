Xavier

Ok, I know I said I was bowing out, but I don&#039;t want to misrepresent myself.  I really, truly am not James Clear.

My full name is Nathan Miracle, hence Nate M.

Flattering that you would think so, but still off the mark.

... aaaand now I DO want James to chime in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/time-assets#comment-13097&quot;&gt;Nate M&lt;/a&gt;.

I appreciate the follow-up.

I don&#039;t think people were being haters (with one exception). They were simply asking if they&#039;d missed something in the analogy and asked for clarification. Nothing wrong with that. 

And I take your points. But I still don&#039;t like the time asset/debt idea. For example, joining the PTA. Time debt? Well, what if you make a new acquaintance through that time invetment that helps build and grow your business, like say a massive new client. You probably wouldn&#039;t have predicted that. 

Serendipity is alive and well in this world. Thank god. Living your life and basing your all your actions as if your rationale brain can predict the outcome of everything we do, good or bad, is naive to say the least, and somewhat narcissistic.

PS. I had a hunch after your first post but now I&#039;m certain that Nate M is actually a pseudoynm for James Clear. So thanks for engaging!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/time-assets#comment-13058&quot;&gt;Xavier&lt;/a&gt;.

An over-defensive relative who sounds arrogant?  Well, that&#039;s just name-calling!  :-)  Seriously though, I did sound arrogant, I&#039;ll grant you that.  So I&#039;ll recant my tone, but reiterate my point (perhaps more clearly from lack of arrogance).  My point: I won&#039;t disregard a good point just because it came wrapped in a poor analogy.  That&#039;s not how I roll.  A couple of time-honored adages come to mind - &quot;Don&#039;t judge a book by its cover,&quot; and &quot;Don&#039;t throw the baby out with the bath water.&quot;  

About James&#039; glaring absence that&#039;s just not cool...  I&#039;ll hazard a guess and say that he&#039;s focusing on the road and not the wall, just as he wrote about in his Haters and Critics article.  Whether you think that&#039;s cool or not cool, a win or a fail, it seem that he at least walks his talk.  I can respect that.

As for time debts, I do believe I’ve spent enough of my time commenting on this thread, and I’ve no desire for it to take up more of my time in the future.  I’ve enjoyed our brief repartee Xavier, but I will bow out now and “put my eyes back on my own paper.”  If you would like the last word, it is yours friend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent strategy for peeling back the onion layers of time vampires!

The license plate thing reminds me of Van Halen&#039;s &quot;Green M&#038;M&quot; strategies from the 1980&#039;s to make sure promoters were reading their requirements. 

Keep up the great work!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/time-assets#comment-13019&quot;&gt;Nate M&lt;/a&gt;.

I think you make some fair points, but I also think you&#039;ve jumped to James defense a little too strongly. You come off like an over-defenseive relative and no one cares what multi-million contracts you&#039;ve read, it adds nothing to your point. You just sound arrogant.

Let&#039;s acknowledge that most every comment on this article suggests his Steve  Jobs analogy was misguided, or at least misuderstood by the majority of readers, and it&#039;s disappointing to not have James chime in to 1) clarify 2) answer the various questions from commenters 3) just admit it was a bad analogy. 

Clearly we all respect his writing or we wouldn&#039;t be here.  But it seems he only wants to engage his readers when they are on his side.

On every other article where commenters cheer him on he&#039;s there to thank them or add to the conversation.  Here he&#039;s glaringly absent, and that&#039;s just not cool.

 Monumental fail if I ever saw one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the analogy of Steve Jobs&#039; car:  It really doesn&#039;t matter to me.  This is not an article about Steve Jobs or his car.  If it was, then I would not have read it, because Steve Jobs&#039; car has zero impact on my life.  The article is about time management (or as Jim Vaughan correctly states it, &quot;Activity Management.&quot;).  The Steve Jobs analogy, as written, directly supports Mr. Clear&#039;s point regarding saving time in the future, by managing your choices now.  That suffices for me.  I&#039;ve read multimillion dollar contracts without such internal consistency.

Regarding Xavier&#039;s comment &quot;Many entrepreneurs build products that ultimately fail, but they learn a lot from that failure. Only doing things you are certain will turn out to be time assets seems like &#039;playing it safe&#039;...&quot;  In the case of the entrepreneur, the asset action is &quot;building products.&quot;  Depending on your business strategy and the environment in which your business resides, you may focus your &quot;building products&quot; activity on the sure bet products to stabilize your business, or you could focus it on &quot;building NEW products&quot; to expand your business (or some mix between both). You can even adjust the mix as business needs and the business environment changes.  But if you spend your time &quot;building products&quot; you increase your chance at gaining something in the future, and if you spend your time &quot;counting and re-counting your beans&quot;, you will not likely gain much of anything.

Ultimately, I like the point of viewing your time as a finite resource, and choosing your actions to conserve it in the future, rather than waste it.  My personal take-away from this article, is that thought that if you can take an action now to save time in the future, then making that action a habit would multiply your time-gain.  Even if it only brings you a 1% time-gain, you may find it still well worth the effort.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought a new car last month and the dealer took care of getting the plates and mailed them directly to me. I didn&#039;t do a thing. How&#039;s that for time management?

I think Jobs knew this as well. I think he just didn&#039;t want a plate. But now I have lost all of that time asset with the this time debt. :(]]></description>
