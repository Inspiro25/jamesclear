					<description><![CDATA[I can only assume that you don&#039;t write an article every Monday and Thursday, and that you are taking December off. Every Tuesday and Saturday morning for most of 2014, I&#039;ve sat down with my cup of coffee &#038; have read your latest article! However December has felt a bit empty without reading a new pearl of wisdom on these days. So I&#039;m just going to reread some old articles!!! Lets see what 2015 brings!!! Thanks again James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you James for all your wonderful articles.

I have been reading them for a year and did not have the confidence to comment. They have been so insightful and at times just uncannily with great timing. 

I enjoyed all these 10. Have a great rest &#038; recharge. Looking forward to your articles in 2015.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the list, sir!

You&#039;re so good at writing. I learned a lot from every article I&#039;ve read from your blog. I can say that most of them hit me right through my heart!

Thank you for being such an inspiration!]]></description>
