					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,

You know I was so silly! I thought that if people are not ready they can&#039;t start to do their things well! Anyways, this article is waking me up from my non-stop dreaming! I&#039;ll start to do what I want from this time on.

Thanks. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very good article.

I want to start a blog and I keep pushing its launching in time - because I don&#039;t feel ready - but will I ever be?

I think I will just write down the launching date and do it then, regardless of how much I will be prepared!

Thanks! It was very motivating.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2 hours ago I was in one of the busiest roads in Luanda, Angola, and I just thought and asked myself why don&#039;t we have a Virgin company here? There are so many things and business to be done in a country like ours, I wondered. How about Virgin Active? Simple!

I then started thinking how great Sir Richard Branson is. I came across this article on Facebook now and I have to thank you, James, for writing such an inspiring article.

Thank you.]]></description>
