					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/willpower-decision-fatigue#comment-4002&quot;&gt;Christa&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Vincent and Christa, 

I agree with the creativity bit. And I think it&#039;s mostly because fatigue keeps the biggest enemy of creativity at bay.

Analysis. Our brain doesn&#039;t want to analyze anything when it&#039;s fatigued and therefore allows uninhibited, uncensored flow of creativity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, I&#039;m 55 yrs of age and diagnosed with ADHD last year. I do take medication daily and found it has made a surprising difference, particularly when I was studying last year. This disability has been with me all my life and therefore I have been destructive in career choices and in love life. With the help of a psychologist and medication, I&#039;ve had to rethink, organise, prioritise, my life and now feel like I have more control.  Naturally the psychologist and medication can only do so much and the rest is up to me. So lately I&#039;ve read a few prints but found little impact in retraining myself. I&#039;m not sure how I came across your site, but have found inspiration in your articles. It is a challenging, anxious but exciting path ahead and your writing certainly does have an impact in  readjusting my way of life. Great articles on motivation, routine, creativity and now decision fatigue. I look forward to your posts and will keep tweaking my thoughts, habits and decisions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, great article as always, I just wanted to add one more consideration about the study. One of the factors besides the time of day can be the monotony of his work, wonder how his &quot;daily rejection curve&quot; would look if he, for example split his job in two shifts and spend a few hours in between doing something completely unrelated (like relaxing with his family). But since we both know such studies (even if more judges were included) are demonstrating correlation at best (and not necessarily causation) it really makes sense for everyone to try things out for themselves.

During my own research into this subject and what has in the end best worked for me, I have actually come to believe that trying to &quot;exercise&quot; your willpower towards changing your habits is not only the hardest way, but it can actually be counterproductive (since it predisposes a state of inner conflict we must learn to be able to &quot;fight&quot; for the foreseeable future). In my opinion the solution is better sought after in the direction of lessening the severity of our decisions (or more precise our perception of them). Just my 5c. :)

Keep up the good work...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed reading this. Decision fatigue is something I currently struggle with. I have never really put it down to willpower or the lack thereof though. It has always been too much focus on the results (or lack thereof). :-) 

Enlightening post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/willpower-decision-fatigue#comment-3804&quot;&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;.

Vincent, I agree with your assessment of creative ideas!  I think it&#039;s because creative decision making requires fatigue.  It&#039;s not about being awake, alert, and in a good mood, easily ready to say yes because you are feeling great.  In creative decision making we are often being true to our own creative vision.  All day long we are alert, and learn about which creative professional is making the most money and how they&#039;re doing it.  Logically we think we need to be more like the high grossing pros.  After we spend all day trying to execute a vision that&#039;s not authentically ours we get nothing done.  In reality we are more uninhibited at the end of the day, late at night when we are working and HAVE to get it done because then we don&#039;t have time to mull over how someone else would do it.  At that point we have to draw on our own strengths and execute our own vision to get the job done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, I heard this research presented with an additional factor: blood sugar.  Eating elevates blood sugar and that &#039;improves&#039; the decision-making energy of the judges.  One suggestion was to have a snack mid-morning and mid-afternoon to reverse or lessen the effects of decision-fatigue.  Any thoughts on this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny! Was reading about same thing in &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;, by Daniel Kahneman (a Nobel laureate and path-breaking psychologist and researcher).

Decision fatigue, also referred to as Ego Depletion can be averted with glucose being taken to restore one&#039;s &#039;self-control&#039; (I guess that&#039;s willpower). The &#039;Thinking Slow&#039; is all about effortful processing that involves holding ideas in one&#039;s working memory as one applies reasoning and logic -- that&#039;s decision making ... and this requires one to &#039;pay attention&#039; which comes from a limited budget of mental energy which is shared by self-control and cognitive effort. So, if one there&#039;s an energy budget depletion both self-control and cognitive function suffer!

A fascinating read, this subject.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

Really enjoy your work, as I hope you know from past comments.  I think consideration needs to be given to blood glucose level variability,  and it&#039;s effect upon brain function.  A drop in blood glucose hours after eating a high carbohydrate, (high glycemic index) which would happen at about the same times noted in the study, can effect the decision making process and even the &quot;will&quot; to make decisions.  It may be that a solution can be found in the suggestions you make, but they seen to be more about treating the symptoms, rather than addressing the cause, which may be poor nutritional habits.  Your solution is the more practical, considering the nutritional habits of most people, but lowering blood glucose levels throughout the day and eating more protein and fat can give the energy to make decisions all day long.  I have recently, (past two years) experimented with nutritional plans, not diets, and have found that a low blood glucose level throughout the day, with fat and protein, noting that each person must find their levels, significantly enhances body and brain energy levels.]]></description>
