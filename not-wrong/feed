Thank you, James. I&#039;m quite blown away by your way of thinking. Starting small suits me well.

As for this: &quot;There’s no rule that you have to be a total failure or an incredible success. It’s a spectrum. You can start out on one side and slowly move towards the other end.&quot; 

Respect. And much gratitude.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could also say &quot;positive&quot; vs. &quot;not negative,&quot; which carries the message home to me a little more strongly.

People seem to struggle with the concept of idealism—of striving after an ideal—as if pursuit of ideals is actually negative, as if failure to make it to perfection will somehow destroy them. But this is like saying not being God is cause for committing suicide. Aiming at the sun is not the same as wanting to actually walk on the sun; it simply provides trajectory. You can set a goal to get there even as you know you&#039;ll never make it. The difference is having the intellectual chops (understanding the solar system, literally or figuratively) to go with your emotional intelligence (knowing how to commit to goals and persist).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/not-wrong#comment-1344&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh, I&#039;m sure we can obsess too much in our quest for &quot;right&quot; just as we can obsess too much on the perils of &quot;failure.&quot; As with most things in life, it&#039;s about balance: driven enough to not back down from failure, flexible enough to move forward when things aren&#039;t perfect. 

This balance is something I battle with all the time (and I think it&#039;s something we all struggle with). It requires constant tending, but if you make an active effort to be aware of it, then I think you&#039;ll be better off for it.

Thanks for reading, Mike!]]></description>

Matt -- great point and an important distinction to make because failure is exactly that, a learning experience. 

Let me know how your learning strategy works out. It sounds interesting and I&#039;d love to hear about your results. 

Keep up the good work! And thanks for reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/not-wrong#comment-1353&quot;&gt;marshall moose moore&lt;/a&gt;.

Great points. I like the cross-over between life and rock climbing too -- a lot of parallels there. 

As far as &quot;climbing protection&quot; goes in life, here&#039;s one idea... 

For my business ideas, I test them out, iterate, and scrap them if they are losers. The most I&#039;ve lost is $1,500 in a business venture. It wasn&#039;t fun, but it&#039;s better to do that than to ride something forever because you&#039;re tied to your idea. The amount that I&#039;m &quot;willing to lose&quot; to test an idea is different based on the business, but I stick to lean launches and make sure that I limit my downside. 

I&#039;d imagine there are a thousand ways you can apply a similar strategy to other areas of life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/not-wrong#comment-1352&quot;&gt;Geetali&lt;/a&gt;.

Geetali -- great question. It&#039;s definitely something to think about and it&#039;s something I battled through when I started my first business. 

My take is: why does it have to be one or the other? Why do you have to quit everything to try something you love? Why not start by doing a little piece -- a hobby or a side project or taking on just one client -- and then go from there? 

There&#039;s no rule that you have to be a total failure or an incredible success. It&#039;s a spectrum. You can start out on one side and slowly move towards the other end.

Good luck!]]></description>
