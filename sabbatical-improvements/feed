					<description><![CDATA[I SO appreciate everything you have done to produce quality writing that has real value for readers like me. I get so sick of fly-by-night studies that mean nothing and are contradicted a few months later. Thank you for removing the distractions and for going to such lengths to produce content that has stood the test of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As always James, a great read. 

I always seem to be able to make time to read your articles as they inspire me and open my mind to new thinking. 

I usually read your Thursday post before writing my own blog post on a Friday, as it inspires me to write.

Keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I&#039;ve been fortunate in life I have been following my passion as a full-time bronze artist for 29 years. My first passion was rodeo I started riding Broncs and Bulls when I was 16. I know that every expert was a beginner at some time and that makes me want to try anything my heart and passion wants to.

When I started sculpting I knew nothing about it. I saw a bronze sculpture by Wyoming artist Harry Jackson of a cowboy riding a bucking horse when I was 23 years old. Just seeing that sculpture ignited a spark in me. 

I have never considered myself a self-taught artists I am a self-educated artist. I know I have learned from others along with my experiences and the books I&#039;ve read.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge with others. I believe talent and knowledge can be expanded with desire and determination as long as you believe in yourself and never give up. My life is a perfect example of that. You can view my art at www.chrisnavarro.com 

Thanks 

Chris Navarro]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I respect your dedication and professionalism, each article you publish I distribute gregariously and also file in my personal library for easy access.

The only comment I can add is to justify your text--it provides a better reading experience and is easier on the eyes. 

Keep inspiring,

Denise, check out the Buffer App (bufferapp.com) and browser add-on. Allows you to click a button to share a link to web-page on your chosen social networks - LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. - very useful for minimalist blogs like James&#039;s. 

Also - fantastic post, James. All great ideas that I&#039;ll be adopting in future.]]></description>
