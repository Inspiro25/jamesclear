					<description><![CDATA[I know for a fact that I would have been one of the children that didn&#039;t eat the marshmallow. I know that because when I was barely four I taught myself how to meditate every day, and I spent much of my time doing large jigsaw puzzles. As well as that I could wait extremely patiently for what I wanted, and I still can.

What they didn&#039;t include in the quiz was what gender they were and what life their parents gave them. That makes a difference in the beginning of their life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting, especially the twist in the more recent studies. I know of times I have been very able to delay gratification and times I have not been. So I contend I have been unconsciously swayed by recent events in both directions. 

Thus, anecdotally coupled with this article I know I can rebuild those muscles. Woohoo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/delayed-gratification#comment-7538&quot;&gt;Jeanne&lt;/a&gt;.

So? Does this mean anyone should not publish anything of a general nature without provisos. “...this high percentage of the population” equates to 3 percent of 1 percent of the population! Which means this article applies to 99.9997 percent.
Understandably Jeanne is sensitive to this subject but that is no reason to endlessly publish every proviso you can think of, and probably still not cover the entire field of exceptions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,
This is really well done. 

I&#039;ve been struggling with my relationship to sugar/caffeine/alcohol ever since I came into my early 30&#039;s... now 33. The sweets part of it has been a struggle since as far back as I can remember.

I notice my desire for these things go high when I am emotionally troubled. After my last 2 relationships not working out I noticed after each one the drive for these things got very strong and tends to drive me to the &quot;buy now/pay later&quot; of not going for discipline and &quot;delayed gratification&quot; with these things. It always seems to lead to the same place of suffering when I chose to have these things now just cuz I want them and want to avoid my sadness, loneliness, frustration, depression and/or anxiety.

I recently did 120 days without these things on a paleo based way of eating and felt more grounded and stable. It was hard in the beginning when I started but as time went on I noticed myself feeling calmer and more able to handle life without sweets/caffeine/alcohol. When I decided to try putting back in some wine/fruit and eventually caffeine I immediately got inflammation/skin problems along with being extremely ungrounded again and spaced out, and found myself addicted all over again. 

Your article hits the nail on the head based on my experience. Thanks!]]></description>
