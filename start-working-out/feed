					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the awesome advice.

You are totally right with that workout calendar. I fell off track so many times that I am super motivated to go back but this time I want to stick with it.  I am actually looking into working with a personal trainer who taught a class I LOVED going to and with how motivating she is in class I am sure working with her will be just as great. Plus, I know she can get me going in the right direction. I&#039;d ask my friends like you suggested but most of them focus on lifting when all I am really looking to do is just loose some of this weight before a wedding I will be in this summer. 

Thank you for the motivational blog thought! I can&#039;t wait to hit the gym after work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/start-working-out#comment-10398&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;.

Found myself nodding in agreement through the entire article. I started off too fast on the sprints (though I use time not distance). It got to the point after a couple sessions that I dreaded the thought of doing them again. And fell off the wagon. Now I push enough to feel like I&#039;m doing work but not that I&#039;m going to die. At least on most of the workouts. But I will go completely all out every few workouts. But I&#039;m mentally and physically prepared to do it after getting my body/mind ready.

Also a key is to start a workout even if you&#039;re not &quot;motivated&quot; to workout. Just start it and you will more than likely get motivated and do it. And never do a workout half heartedly. Do it like you mean it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. Thank you! I&#039;ve always wanted to be good at pull-ups but at this point, I can barely do one. Can you recommend how to get started?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, starting to fast is what I always did, after a couple weeks it becomes too much. Now I think learning  the routine and following it for three day a week for about a month is a good way to start.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/start-working-out#comment-713&quot;&gt;Darius B.&lt;/a&gt;.

I totally understand your thought about missing workouts when the weather is not so good. Not sure where you live but in S. Florida it rains all the time and as a past long distance runner I found that running in various conditions was very helpful in my training. It taught me how to gauge my endurance and really puts you in tuned to your capabilities based on the weather. It makes you a better athlete and the best athletes, especially professional athletes are well prepared to perform in all weathers. If you are worried about being cold, you will warm up once you are moving.

Get GOOD GEAR, shop and try different fabrics, FEEL THEM so you can recognize good fabric in cheaper stores without having to always spend a lot. Having good gear will help in that you will be more comfortable and your clothes wont stink or expand once you start to sweat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, I just discovered your site today thanks to a friend sharing an article of yours on Facebook.  Great stuff, well written, logical, no-nonsense.  I like it. Here&#039;s my dilemma, wondering if you have any thoughts...  

I&#039;m 6&#039;4&quot; and I&#039;ve dropped 48 pounds in the past 7 months.  Down to 250 lbs now.  I did so through an overhauled diet and I&#039;ve been running about 2.7 miles three mornings per week.  Before March of this year, I haven&#039;t run or exercised AT ALL since high school P.E. class. I&#039;ve logged every run and it definitely helps to keep track and look at the progress over time. No plans to stop running, as it&#039;s slowly getting easier and I&#039;m getting faster.

My question...  My (admittedly silly) goal, to start, is to do one Pullup. Trouble is, even with the reduced weight, I&#039;m still in no shape to even do the one. So I&#039;m looking to start building upper-body strength.  Obviously I need to keep working at reducing the weight, but I think the lack of strength is what&#039;s keeping me from doing a pull-up.  Any suggestions on where to start? Which exercises to focus on, how many and how often? I don&#039;t exactly live near a gym, so anything home-based/D.I.Y. would be great, but that&#039;s not a deal-breaker.

Thanks for the great articles.  I plan to read more...]]></description>
