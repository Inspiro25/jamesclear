					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, I follow your posts regularly and learn a lot from them and I&#039;m able to apply them too. I really wanted to know bout the good books in your collection. 

Thanks for sharing about them. I loved the last line where you&#039;ve written there are no 3-star, 2-star or 1-star books... Haha...

Wish you the best health to accomplish all you have in your mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved &quot;Surely you must be joking!&quot;  Especially the part about trying to hallucinate in the especially deprivation chamber. It just shows how very curious Feynman was!

Currently I&#039;m reading &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot; by Daniel Kahneman. It&#039;s amazing and I believe right up your alley...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing these books. I read a lot of fiction, but I often struggle to find nonfiction I&#039;m interested in. For many years I didn&#039;t touch it. I&#039;ve been looking for some great NF reads, I&#039;m especially interested in the first two on your list.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A book I just finished is Relentless by Tim Grover. Not for the feint-hearted and be aware... his use of language may offend some... but his book is a no-holds-bar in your face here&#039;s what it takes to be the best type of book. From a man who worked with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Dwayne Wade to name a few.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice list. I just got from the library today &quot;Twenty-Eight Artists and Two Saints,&quot; essays by Joan Acocella. I suppose it is old news to your readers, but I was led to it while looking for some poetry at my local library. I&#039;m very excited to read it. Thanks for the other recommendations.]]></description>
