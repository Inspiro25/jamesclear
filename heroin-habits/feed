					<description><![CDATA[Never realized how important your environment is to shape your behaviors. Thank you for the advice of not automatically going straight home after work and going back to the place where you are reminded of your stress.

Gave me a lot to think about and the changes I am going to make!

This posting also reminds me of a quote I once heard: &quot;You are the average of your 9 best friends. If all 9 friends are broke, it&#039;s mostly likely you will be the 10th one&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the article.  As a Vietnam veteran, and one who spent an interim assignment at the US Army Drug Rehab Center in DaNang in &#039;71, I can offer a point not covered above. 

Under the provisions of the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice),  the penalties for possession/use of Marijuana and Heroin were identical.   Smoking Heroin was detectable only by urinalysis while smoking Marijuana was obvious to any in the immediate area at the time of use. 

The end result was that the majority of Heroin &quot;addicts&quot; were recreational Marijuana users who chose the less detectable high.   Further, the military definition of an &quot;addict&quot; was not that of civilian medicine -- a positive urinalysis prior to DEROS (date of estimated return from overseas) was sufficient. 

Thus, Heroin &quot;addiction&quot;  in RVN was less a reflection of addictive personality than of evasion of the penalties of recreational drug use. 

That said, many who used drugs recreationally did so to escape the stress of combat and/or the tedium between periods of combat. 

On return from Vietnam, that stress disappeared along with the desire/need for drugs for the majority of returnees; with the exception of those with PTSD or addictive personality types. 

Thus, the article&#039;s premise of changing environments is valid,  but for reasons rather unique to the situation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I changed my environment to get up without snoozing, by switching from my traditional alarm clock to a new alarm from my cell phone. (I was going to buy a new alarm clock, but then realized my phone could do that job).

I practiced my new ritual of throwing off the covers and sitting up BEFORE turning off my new alarm... I did it about 3 times. Yes, I practiced getting up. I did this to create the routine in my brain. Then from day 1, I didn&#039;t have to think... my brain just played the new routine in response to the new alarm (and from a new alarm source). Three weeks later, it&#039;s still working.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What make James Clear&#039;s writings of great value to me are the following:

1. Easy to read as he makes his prose simple yet specific.
2. Evidenced-based by providing studies, published papers, and all the pertinent data.
3. Deals with key issues or root causes (habits) rather than superficial ones.]]></description>
