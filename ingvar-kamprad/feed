					<description><![CDATA[How do you overcome that feeling that everyone else is racing ahead and already becoming successful, while you&#039;re taking the time and slowly building skills? Building skills takes a LOT of time. And more than patience, it takes the resilience to keep at it while you watch others make money out of mediocrity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/ingvar-kamprad#comment-10867&quot;&gt;Matt S&lt;/a&gt;.

I would also like to see a post on late bloomers. So many entrepreneurial sites hype up young people who are already succeeding, and combined with the knowledge that it takes 10 years to get good at something that leaves a lot of us feeling like it&#039;s hopeless to even start if you&#039;re 30. This post is about someone who got started as a boy. It&#039;s a great story for inspiration or as a parable, but... The IKEA website says he started selling matches when he was 5 years old and it took 6 decades to build into a retail chain. How many 5 year-olds are reading this website, and how many readers have 6 decades of life left?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

This affirms exactly what I believe as a life coach!  I&#039;m investing in the craft and my focus is delivering high quality content and services for every single client.  Although some are pushing me to &#039;go bigger&#039;, it&#039;s more important to me right now that I focus on helping my individual clients get results.  I find that greatly rewarding, and I trust there will be more and more clients in the future!   

Thanks for sharing, 
Linda]]></description>
