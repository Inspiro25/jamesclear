Wendy -- thanks for the kind words. I believe Henkie Holvast died in 2004, but I couldn&#039;t confirm that for sure so I left it out of the article. Here&#039;s to hoping he lived a long and happy life after World War II.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the article. Thanks for sharing. very interesting.

I love the picture with the boy carrying a spoon, I didn&#039;t know about it. I didn&#039;t know about kids carrying spoons &quot;just in case&quot;.

I wonder what happened with that kid. If anybody knows (I tried to research about him), please let me know. We have multiple reasons to be grateful.

Life is full of history, sadly is not always good.

Like Einstein said: &quot;The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This story just exemplifies why I am absolutely thankful to the Living God for the food I eat everyday. We are so blessed to go shopping, cook our meals, eat our food, feed our children, not worrying about our next meal is a way to reduce stress and being thankful for this is the proper response.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James ... is not the primary cause of the problems bad nutrition rather than stress. I have worked with the 142,000 Dutch Civilians who were incarcerated into Japanese prisoner of war camps during World War II. They were essentially starved, but survived on what they could find to eat. They probably benefited from the fact that Indonesia has a tropical climate and there is something edible to find all year. What surprised me was how many men and women ended up living into their 90s eating only what they could find which was hot peppers. Granted, there were also many who suffered severe psychological disorders, but much of that was probably associated with the torture, pain and suffering they personally experienced and witnessed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Jessica--this may be mostly about starvation. The book The Great Starvation Experiment describes some of the psychological effects on starvation on a group of men at the University of Minnesota around the same period. To a pretty good extent, the subjects were listless, like the prisoners at liberated concentration camps. They cared about little besides food. To be sure, people in a war zone had far more stressors than subjects in an experiment in the US. Certainly more than nearly anyone in a contemporary, first-world country. But the presence of severe starvation makes it a huge confounding variable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that negative stress in which one would experience through a famine or as a reaction to things that happen in daily life can harmfully impact a person. It is important to be able to reduce this kind of stress but also to work on the reaction to situations, as well. A TED talk by Kelly McGonigal makes some good points about stress. I work to apply both strategies in order to minimize stress overall.
