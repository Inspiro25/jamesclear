					<description><![CDATA[Quite an interesting read.

A few years back I was so invested in becoming a great draughtsman that I passionately drew every day, for many hours, and eventually I got a Scholastic Gold Medal for work I did at 14. Now, at 19, I stopped passionately drawing and it has been only last year that I had time for myself, gained more wisdom than in my years of high school, and enjoy my life now, even with its very harsh flaws.

I want to live my passion, but a large part of me is scared that I will become like my parents and former friends. Overburned by work, depressed, and losing my soul in the process.

But your article made me realize that if I will ever achieve those dreams, I will need to transform from an anxious, procrastinating daydreamer to an autonomous and active adult. It is something interesting to think about.

Thanks, James.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

The idea of the &quot;10 Years of Silence&quot; is an amazing way to drill down the truth of what &quot;Super-Achiever&quot; really go through to rise to the level of the significant few. Most people see geniuses or talent as people born &quot;lucky&quot; or with some kind of super-power. There is no doubt that Mozart was a genius, but without the kind of practice he put in, he would have just been an &quot;ordinary&quot; genius instead of a brilliant one. I love the idea of focused practice too. Practice with purpose, not just putting in the time with the occasional distraction pulling you off the sidelines. Brilliant post to wake up to, thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful post, James. This was exceptionally helpful.

I&#039;m working toward on my &quot;10 years of silence&quot; to become a world class geneticist to unlock immortality. 

Deliberate practice is a wonderful thing to keep in mind. 

Thanks a bunch. You keep it up; I&#039;ll do the same. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jay!!

Great article, I read your articles all the time and read this out loud to my girlfriend. We both agreed that this was an amazing and useful article as all your others. Thanks for realizing your goal of writing because if you hadn&#039;t, you wouldn&#039;t have made an impact on my life.

I have that book. This article is so much better than that book - more motivating despite the brevity. THANK YOU for this article and all of your other articles as well. I can&#039;t believe I only just found this site.

You&#039;re an amazing writer - keep it up (for all of us)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I practice &quot;The Art of Peace&quot; that is Aikido. So far have done it for two months and still going. I believe in the 10 years of silence. I also do my best in practice and I can&#039;t imagine what I will be like in a 10-year time.

Thank you, James, for this wonderful presentation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice#comment-4217&quot;&gt;Georges&lt;/a&gt;.

Georges, that&#039;s a really great question. You might have an answer by now, but I&#039;ll offer mine anyway.

Break your big goal down into smaller steps -- what do you need to do to reach that goal? E.g., Learn about entrepreneurship, study business management, define exactly what kind of social and environmental impact you want to make and then determine what you need to know and do to make that impact. One very useful way to help answer these questions is to interview people who are doing something similar to what you want to do. Explain your goal/dream/motivation and ask if they would be willing to give you a little of their time. You could offer to take them to lunch or meet for coffee. Talk to lots of people. Tap your instructors for advice and referrals to other people who could help you. Also do lots of reading and research until you have a really specific picture of how to reach your goal. And, if possible, gain some direct experience via interning or volunteering or working for an entrepreneur doing something similar to what you want to do.

Once you have notes on solid steps that you need to take, organize those into short-, medium-, and long-term goals. Then break each of those down into bite-sized pieces. Then pick 1-3 to work on today. Repeat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I linked here from the article on how long it takes to form a habit, and both posts were credibly informational and helpful, thank you.

Both also solidified my resolve, established last night, to establish a discipline of doing 8 particular things. One of them is practicing playing the drums (drumset), which I started to learn almost 2 years ago at the age of 42. I have been frustrated by my lack of progress this year, but know that it&#039;s directly attributable to laziness. 

I looked up (via Google) how long it took to establish a new habit, because my recent experience has been that it took at least 2 months -- which jibes with your post on that topic.

This post is particularly helpful in demonstrating the value of structured practice, thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just want to thank you for a wonderful post. I have been very discouraged in many aspects of my life recently and today while at work I had an epiphany, that stemmed from my recent rereading of selections from Walden by Thoreau in which he famously states:
 
&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.&quot;

At that time I decided that to get where I wanted to be in my personal and professional life I needed to do one thing, &quot;live deliberately&quot;. That is what led me to this article. 

I love how you have taken the concept of living deliberately and put it into a real life perspective. I am a social studies teacher, baseball coach, and basketball coach. I plan on taking this advice and implementing it in my own life to reach my greater goals. I also plan to share this with some of my students and players to show them what it takes to achieve the goals they have set for the season and in their own lives.

I preach everyday in my class and at practice that it is not about the time we are there but instead about the work they put in during that time. That generally goes in one ear and out the other. If they see the work that Kobe (for the athletes) and Mozart and Picasso (for the artists) put in to get to the highest level it will be more meaningful. 

Once again thank you for this post. Keep up the good work. I plan on returning regularly to gain more insight and inspiration in to achieving my goals and helping others achieve theirs.
