					<description><![CDATA[I wish I could find a good way to share this with my current boss, who is new to his role as a senior leader.  He&#039;s just brimming with ideas and is gleefully delegating them out to the team, to the extent that it&#039;s becoming increasingly hard to actually get any work done or to adequately follow through and deliver on the many other projects. 

Great analogy, I&#039;ll keep it in the file and see if I can figure out how to use it tactfully!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you James. I have the same exact problem. Loved this article, it calmed me down. Is there a way to talk to you if you are free?

Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s absolutely true. I think if you make your mind to be a successful person on all your life&#039;s branches you should focus on highly important tasks, I am talking about those tasks that you love and they will impact on your productivity clearly.

Just choose your clear goals and act toward them day and night until you achieve them.

Thanks for your informative article.

To your outstanding success

Hello James, I am amazed that thanking respondents or commentators is one of those things you give your quality time. Not a common with many. Thank you for being there for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE this analogy, it really helps to see things in perspective. I as much as anyone can relate to that mixture of excitement and exasperation when I get a new idea in my life when I&#039;m already bogged down with chasing my existing ones.

Brilliant stuff, James :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great article James, thanks for taking the time to research and write it.  I&#039;m going through this stage right now.  New baby, many responsibilities at work and church, new job, and photography hobby that I once thought I could go professional with.  I have to prune that out for now, and just let it be a hobby.]]></description>
