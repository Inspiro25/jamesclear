					<description><![CDATA[Hi James. I especially resonate with your comment &quot;It may have started as my idea, but it rapidly became our mission.&quot;

I&#039;ve seen too many people get overwhelmed by huge concepts of purpose and mission. I encourage people to start with their ideas, their passions, their gifts. Can they build skills on top of those? Their mission will likely evolve from there. Building a mission, a purpose, for our lives is worthy of lots of dreaming, thinking, and action. 

Thanks for a great post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, 

Thank you for this.  Great insights into teams and mentors!   A good reminder on all fronts for all of us.  I am a member of many &quot;teams&quot; I realize, but forget that they are not just committees to serve on, but a team that works together to make things better.  I happen to lead one of these &quot;teams&quot; at first reluctantly, but see now that my team supports one another, all for the good we are working toward and it doesn&#039;t seem so scary to be a leader now!  It feels like one whole organic entity.  We share the passion and we all contribute our own gifts and strengths.  Great article and well said.  Keep it coming.

					<description><![CDATA[James, I just like to say thank you. Your ideas toward life that you express through your messages affect me much, in a good way. I must say I&#039;m starting to develop a healthy habit after reading your works, the one with exercise counteracts depression. That helps me. Now, eventhough slowly, I can feel I&#039;m becoming a better person. I read every messages you sent because it actually matters.
I am happy I subscribe you and become a part of this community you&#039;ve created.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/life-team-sport#comment-908&quot;&gt;Jennie&lt;/a&gt;.

Jennie -- I&#039;m feeling much better. Thanks for thinking of me. 

You make a great point. We often ignore just how valuable our current relationships are to us. I know I&#039;ve been guilty of that. 

Thanks for reading! And maybe I should check out Sandberg&#039;s book.

p.s. The meetups are definitely coming! Can&#039;t wait to share more about this.]]></description>

I guess that depends on what you define as formal training. I wrote a lot of papers during undergrad and grad school. I also took a few English classes along the way (not many though). Mostly, I&#039;ve just learned by writing... which I think is the best bet.]]></description>
