					<description><![CDATA[I went to a social work conference years ago at which she was the featured speaker.  I along with everyone there was inspired by her and her great spirit.  She will live forever in the hearts of the countless people she touched through her writing and voice.  I will forever be grateful for her poetry and example of how to live and make something of whatever life dishes out, and make it honest and true.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James, I would love to know why you took the share bottoms off the bottom of your posts.  If you&#039;ve written about that in another post, perhaps you can refer me there.

Thanks very much for sharing this wisdom from Maya Angelou.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Such a powerful article! 

My favorite part:
On finding your calling…

“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”

Reminds me of Les Browns quote - 

&quot;The graveyard is the richest place on earth, because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take that first step, keep with the problem, or determined to carry our their dream.” - Les Brown]]></description>
