					<description><![CDATA[I liked your article.

I want to change 4 things in life:
1. Be nice
2. Work smarter with a positive attitude
3. Be in the best shape of my life.
4. Love my wife more and enjoy life.

I think I can use the 3 R&#039;s. Maybe I am too black and white.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I am a serial procrastinator and I stumbled on to this article from google-ing how to start change. My new habit is simply keeping my room clean. There is so much I should do but I will try to start small and not get ahead of myself.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey James!

This article is fantastic. Question though...This covers developing a brand new habit. Do you have any additional advice on breaking a bad habit and developing a good one in it&#039;s place? At my job, I do everything I can to find the most efficient way to do our every day tasks. When I suggest these things to my co-workers, they agree that it sounds like a better way to go about the task. The problem is that they are so set in the old way of doing things that they think they can&#039;t change. In these cases, they have Reminders, but they trigger the old Routine instead of the new one. Any thoughts on how to re-route where the Reminder takes you to?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I love all of your amazing research and advice on creating new habits. It is so spot on. I recently interview Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz, the world&#039;s leading expert on the science of neuroplasticity (brain change), and he gave some great information on how the steps you outline can actually create new neural pathways in the brain to support a new habit. What you are sharing has a real foundation in science.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Really enjoyed reading this, I Google searched &quot;breaking bad habits&quot; to come across this and I am going to use it to help me break my bad habit of bending and lifting as I have had back injuries recently from a previous one a year ago. My job requires me to bend and lift constantly and although I am aware of correct techniques I become absent-minded and possibly the pressure is the stress factor that causes it. I feel as though I have developed these bad habits over my lifetime and am hoping that the 3 Rs can help reverse what I have been doing for so long.

Wish me luck. Will let ya know if it works. Any advice is welcome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

The way you explain powerful and complex stuff in such a simple way that is easy to understand and follow is just simply amazing. Being an ambitious procrastinator, this post really helps me to develop the necessary habits to overcome my procrastination and fulfill my goals. I believe the information in this post can help thrust my development from being an &#039;ambitious procrastinator&#039; to being an &#039;ambitious go-getter&#039;.]]></description>

By sprint do you mean just jump to it without thinking it through? Because if so, you missed James&#039; whole point. To create the habit loop you have to at least have an overview, I think, of the process.]]></description>
