					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/environment-design-organ-donation#comment-1785&quot;&gt;Claudia&lt;/a&gt;.

I too would love to know how to use this advice to help with self employed problems, like you said, getting to bed on time and working only during working hours (instead of wasting time and &quot;working&quot; all day) while juggling all the work-related tasks I have to do. It&#039;s always a struggle. I wake up every day with the best intentions, and then, as always, I blow it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another great post James... I have tried this in small ways (i.e. I leave floss in my car and use it while stuck in traffic and at red lights). Sounds a little gross, but it works! Since we have placed a bowl of fresh fruit on the dining room table instead of flowers we eat more fruit and I make smoothies almost every day now. I am going to see how I can apply this philosophy to my office where it is much easier to space out on the computer than tackle important tasks first each day... any suggestions from anyone?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great suggestions! I have a terrible time trying to get anything done on my new website idea with all the distractions of a home &quot;office.&quot;  I believe that I can use many of your great tips by just spending a few hours moving things around. In a way, this is a bit like Feng Shui!]]></description>

On a similar note, a very interesting book that talks about how our senses affect us in our everyday lives (and sometimes in ways  we might not expect) is &quot;A Natural History of the Senses&quot; by Diane Ackerman. I&#039;ve been reading this recently and it&#039;s so incredibly fascinating! It&#039;s divided into six sections: Smell, Touch, Taste, Hearing, Vision, and Synesthesia. See it on Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76611.A_Natural_History_of_the_Senses]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While this information can be used to our benefit in our everyday lives, it brings something to light that strikes me as deeply disturbing. This is the kind of information that corporations use to manipulate the masses, which we are completely unaware of. Can you say &quot;Big Brother&quot;? This article, as well as the Choice Architecture one (https://jamesclear.com/choice-architecture) address the fact that because of environment design, we have been manipulated into buying more soda. The doctors (or whoever) that conducted the choice architecture study are more than a big step behind the soda companies who figured this out a long time ago... and we&#039;re only just starting to catch up and realize that they&#039;ve been getting us to make unhealthier decisions for a long time. Good eye opener. 

That said, while I was reading this article, I switched my mouse to the left side of my desk. I&#039;ve been meaning to swap more often and use it in a more balanced way so that my right shoulder and arm aren&#039;t overworked. On my way to being ambidextrous!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/environment-design-organ-donation#comment-1724&quot;&gt;marshall moose moore&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Marshall,

I have a rule with Starbucks: I only use it to get work done. I never have meetings there, never socialize, I only do work when I&#039;m there. I also don&#039;t let myself go online, or do anything else unproductive. 

The first few times it was hard, but now that I&#039;ve made it a habit I can always go to Starbucks for effortless productivity. I&#039;ve made getting to Starbucks a cue to start working, and the reward is getting a lot more done in less time than I would anywhere else. 

It&#039;s a great way to counter the un-productivity of working in my bedroom at home where I also goof off a lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/environment-design-organ-donation#comment-1859&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

I definitely agree w your general premise. Environment plays such a large factor. I&#039;m a big fan of social psych research, and it&#039;s amazing how much &quot;minor details&quot; that you wouldn&#039;t notice consciously are playing a big effect on your reactions.

Here&#039;s an NBC article w the 45% stat: http://www.nbcnews.com/health/transplant-outrage-has-solution-more-organ-donors-6C10256564]]></description>

Melanie -- great point. I was unaware of the US data for organ donations. Where did you find the 45% number at?

Thankfully, I think the general point of our environment being a driver of our actions still holds true &#8212; even if it&#039;s not as strong as the organ donation study makes it seem.

Thanks for reading and sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[US is opt-in for organ donation and the rates are around ~45% depending on the source, so it&#039;s not as cut-and-dry as it&#039;s made out to be. I&#039;d take the data more to heart if it didn&#039;t seem obvious that the data being chosen is data that proves the hypotheses, without regard to data that disproves it.]]></description>
