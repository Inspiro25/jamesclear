					<description><![CDATA[I find this concept inspiring. I have been applying this concept to my life for 2 weeks now. I find it helps me avoid the &quot;all or nothing&quot; mindset, motivates me to continue with my schedule, and allows me to make these changes habits.

I have two goals I am applying this to: Doing a pull up/weight loss and studying for a career-advancing test. My biggest challenge is becoming aware of how easy it is. In that, I feel I should be doing more to reach my goals, however, I have to remind myself that I am creating a habit and that I will be increasing my workload each week, by increasing weights in my workout, or mastering a concept for my test. I have to remind myself that I am working on my 1%.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a fantastic post. Who can&#039;t make 1% improvements on every tiny little thing? It becomes a game. One becomes inquisitive, creative, like we were as children. Always experimenting and seeing what would become of our interactions with the laws of nature. We can remember how to be creative instantly with this insight. It certainly is creative to attain the best pillow and massage oil by testing. I am optimistic now to lose wait for the first time in years. This is an epiphany.

Well played Mr. Clear.
