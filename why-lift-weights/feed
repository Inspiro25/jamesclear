					<description><![CDATA[Good article James. I think other types of physical exercises that challenge you could have that same benefit of knowing your self and your limits. 

The reason I think that is that physical exercise tend to be simple. It&#039;s just about doing x for x seconds for x number of times. And above all, it&#039;s about sticking to this simplicity and just keeping at it.

Keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello James,

Great post by the way.

I am currently writing an ebook about how to lose weight based on my own weight loss journey.

I would like to use quotes from your post. Would that be all right with you? Of course, I would give you the credit in my ebook.

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

Marsha Lecour]]></description>

Suzanne -- yep, lifting weights is awesome! Hopefully you can find your way back to them (or a good substitute)!

Thanks for taking the time to read and share your thoughts! It&#039;s great to have you in our little community!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/why-lift-weights#comment-1501&quot;&gt;Esther L.&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for sharing this, Esther! KungFu is awesome and I&#039;m sure you&#039;re right on the money -- many of the same lessons from weightlifting can be learned when you challenge your body in other ways.

Keep up the great work and thanks for reading!]]></description>
