					<description><![CDATA[This article helped me work through exactly what I was doing that was holding me back with my website and my writing. It provided so much clarity for me. I spent the afternoon measuring backward, and I had this amazing &quot;aha!&quot; moment. I almost feel silly for not thinking of this. 

This is the best (and most effective) &quot;hack&quot; I&#039;ve come across. Thank you, James!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James. Been a while since I last wrote to you!

I strongly agree with the backwards method; its a very good way to look at the progress you&#039;ve actually made in the past to compare it to what you could possibly do in the future. 

I&#039;ll definitely have to start using this because it also ties into your small steps scheme that you encourage people to do.

Once again, great article James. Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m only at the start of my journey with building muscle and changing my body - my PT tells me my body is &quot;Under Construction&quot; which is so true.   I can&#039;t believe what I can do now at the gym compared to six weeks ago.   And my measurements are testament to how hard I am working.

Your words are always so inspiring and so real.  You don&#039;t make anything complicated, its real life and you write it in a way that you connect with so many people - thanks for keeping it real and being someone we can relate to!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this really helped me! Thank you!

I was angry at myself that I haven´t got the results I want yet, but then I looked backward 1 week and saw that I&#039;ve done the absolute best I could have done this week!!!

So it&#039;s totally unfair for me to get angry at myself when I´m doing everything right right now! So I was like celebrating instead. :D Yaay!

I love your articles, and I really like when you make those lists with examples -- that&#039;s when I really understand how I can use your tips!

					<description><![CDATA[Nice Article James!

However, I do believe that it is obvious. One can never measure forward (as the things are not yet executed), one can only plan forward. Once you plan, you make your schedule to execute the plan and then you create benchmarks to track the progress, that is where you start measuring. It is just as simple as that.

Let me know your views!
