					<description><![CDATA[Awesome post! Very thought-provoking. I used to wake up early and start my day with a run. I always found that a great way to set the tone for the rest of my day. I&#039;d like to get back to that space. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a fellow weightlifter (bodybuilder) and somewhat of an entrepreneur, this is an awesome article to help give me some focus. Some mornings pass me by, and before I know it, I&#039;m onto my 3rd meal of the day (I don&#039;t follow intermittent fasting) and I&#039;ve done nothing but check social media, email, and read articles.

Also followed you on Twitter, James.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Suggestions for someone who starts at a different time each day and works an average of 12-14 hours? 

Last week consisted of...
Monday: 2am
Tues: 5am
Weds: 3:30am
Thurs: 7am
Fri: 4am

And all days worked at least 11 hours one day was 16. One was 14.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Number 7 (eat as a reward for working hard) makes me wary. Treating food as anything other than sustenance and starving yourself because you haven&#039;t &quot;deserved&quot; food yet is a huge slippery slope to developing an eating disorder. Eating disorders don&#039;t just develop in people with body image issues- it&#039;s also a huge problem for perfectionists, workaholics, and anyone who is depressed or always stressed out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James this was an interesting e-mail and since I&#039;m 81 I&#039;ve had a few mornings to deal with... and none would I probably change but for a few. I&#039;m pretty much a morning person.  I&#039;m now giving a repeat try at writing a novel that&#039;s been haunting me for quite sometime and having read this I realize I&#039;ve been wasting too many of my mornings.  

Thank you for your &quot;wake up&quot;.
