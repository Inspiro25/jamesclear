					<description><![CDATA[Hi James. Thanks for sharing such wonderful thoughts with us and the best thing about your newsletter is that you write after experiencing personally and are very encouraging.

I will definitely read all your newsletters and try to learn all your messages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You say you&#039;re not an expert... but that&#039;s your strong point. The expert&#039;s are (boringly, I might add) full of theories but you&#039;re one of us. Just a regular person trying new things and that&#039;s one of the reasons I read and enjoy your writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It takes humility to be a student of life, and you definitely are humble about your accomplishment. You have shared so much with everyone. Life&#039;s lessons are to be shared and not kept to one&#039;s self. For if we do not share, the purpose of learning is diminished. We need others to grow and others benefit from our growth. Each one of us is a catalyst with those we interact with, as we permeate each and everyone&#039;s life with lessons learned that eventually reflects our actions. We now see things differently from our experiencing the process be it bad or good. 
Kudos to you my friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

You mentioned you are working toward Service and teamwork. Believe me, you have already achieved a lot. 2013 was a rough year for me -- I went thru depression, still am on medication -- and struggled for months to find a way out of it. I tried lots of websites, articles, books, and nothing was working, I wasn&#039;t seeing any progress, if anything, I was seeing regress. Thanks to your articles, I was able to stick to habits and develop a process that is helping me a lot and, on my MDs words, &quot;the worst is behind us.&quot; I am not sure where I would be without your articles, probably still trying quick fixes and failing to see any progress. You are truly a Godsend. 

God bless you and keep the good writing.]]></description>
