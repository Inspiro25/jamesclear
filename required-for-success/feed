					<description><![CDATA[Hi All,

James, u regard &quot;doing the work&quot; as an action to do always?

Because sometimes, it may be a consistent behavior set, like the one of the mother to her child; or a consistent style of dressing up, like the one of a fashion icon.

Do I confuse stuff?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James! This post is exactly what I needed today. Many times, I am guilty of obsessing over things that I feel I need to be successful. This is a reminder, that I need to continue to keep working! All other things, will fall into place. Thank you once again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Success is doing the work.

As I learn from people like Steven Pressfield to Ed Dale, this is excellent advice. I try to live this each day, but it&#039;s never easy.

I didn&#039;t know any of this in my teens. I sort of knew of it in my twenties. I was a bit more aware of it in thirties and achieving some success by doing that. Now I&#039;m just grasping it and moving ahead before I make excuses. If you&#039;re young, learn this now. You&#039;ll be much better in the years to come. Thanks for sharing James.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/required-for-success#comment-1961&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey James,

yep, that&#039;s right! People undererstimate that and think too much ahead. Thus the obstacles become too high.

I like your take on it here. I hope it changed some people&#039;s minds :)

Cheers,

Till]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally.  Apply yourself and do the time.  Commit and persevere.  Reminds me of article that revealed how to become the next Eric Clapton, Jimmie page, or Jimi Hendrix.  If you want to be the best guitar player in the world, then ... get ready for it ... here it is ... practice, practice every chance you get.  That&#039;s it, that&#039;s the secret.  The rest is up to you. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I am Sumit from India and I&#039;ve been following your blog for a few weeks now think it is great. Your sense of clarity is impeccable.

Anyway, thanks for the motivation through this post. I really needed it. I have to do a workshop in college two weeks from now and I&#039;m petrified. I am really bad at public speaking (have blanked out twice before on stage). I guess the only way I could get better is by actually doing it many times.

Thanks,
Sumit. :)]]></description>
