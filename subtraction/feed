					<description><![CDATA[This observation has me thinking:
&quot;Second, improvement by subtraction does not require you to achieve a new level of performance. This method is about doing what you are capable of doing more frequently. It is about reducing the likelihood that you’ll perform below your ability.&quot;

I like this ideas because it doesn&#039;t require new knowledge or skills. Here is an application to writing: eliminate passive voice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What do Eli Manning, Joe Flacco, Ben Rothlesberger, Trent Dilfer, Jim Plunkett, and Doug Williams all have in common? They all won Super Bowls without being spectacular.

In fact, one of the greatest QBs of all time, Dan Marino, never won a Super Bowl. He set many statistical records, but never won a Super Bowl. Eli Manning is inferior to his brother Peyton, but he has twice as many Super Bowl victories. Troy Aikman has a career passer rating of 81.6 with 165 TDs and 141 Interceptions. Still he won three Super Bowls. In 2014 Russell Wilson had only 15 TDs, and 205 yards per game, but also only 5 interceptions and a QD rating of 94.7. He won the Super Bowl last year. This is despite being 19th out of 32 in total yards and tied for 102nd in scoring.

Conclusion is that some of the most-winning QBs clearly limited their mistakes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article, thank you.  

It is easy to miss your point that both approaches work, and in fact complement each other. 

I teach a graduate level Quality Improvement course and have the students do a self-improvement project based on the old book “Quality is Personal” by Roberts and Sergesketter.  This particular book and the student projects initially focus on eliminating defects.  This is primarily because defects are easy to measure (just count them) and meaningful results can be achieved rather quickly.  Also as you so effectively point out creating something new (more great work) is often a challenge.

I thought your graphic “Two Paths to Improvement” is perfect.  Especially since it says, at the bottom &quot;Remember, both options work.&quot;  I would like to use this graphic in my lectures (leaving the “JamesClear.com” attribution on the bottom, of course.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really creative way to look at it James. I always focus so much on getting better over and over again. Maybe that did include getting better at what was bad, but I wasn&#039;t consciously paying attention to it.

Bringing things into perspective now, I feel my heights escalated because I have double the things I can improve.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,
I have been able to do HIIT training almost daily for several weeks by sticking to two pieces of advice you gave, that being --- 1) hook your new habit to something that is already a habit and 2) make the new habit so easy to do you find is it almost impossible not to do.
 
So, between putting on various aspects of my makeup in the morning (my daily habit) I set a timer for a minute of very fast and very hard squats (this is so fast and intense I find it easy to do because I don&#039;t have to convince myself).  My rest period (about a minute) is taken up by putting on my lipstick or whatever.  Then, I reset my timer for some pushups, very hard and fast as I can for one minute.  Then, rest again is putting on my mascara.  Then reset the timer and do more squats.  You get the picture.

Then, just keep going &#039;till I have done four rounds of each exercise.  I just blot my face dry before I put on my last bit of makeup (face powder).  So, by the time I am done putting on my makeup I have completed my HIIT training in the privacy of my own home and I am ready for the day.  This is brilliant for me because it makes me far more focused and wide awake than caffeine could ever do.

I have already changed my psyche by doing this simple thing.  I am getting much stronger, muscles showing, and greater endurance.  Plus, I get a tremendous feeling of accomplishments which is a confidence booster.    

Thank you so much,
Jo]]></description>

I sincerely thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post, James. Made me think of my current approach towards my trading endeavors. :) It makes perfect sense to eliminate/reduce errors first before improving for me.

Still, both approaches do work, it depends on how the person prefers.]]></description>
