					<description><![CDATA[Thank you James. Very sound advice!

I had failed at achieving a couple goals in the past &#039;till I stuck to a weekly schedule and now I am seeing very good results. It does get boring but the results I have seen so far are very motivating.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOVE THIS!

I think, also, it comes down to what you have suggested in past blogs: Do a little bit every day. If you feel bored, just START doing whatever you need to do. If you do a little, it&#039;s OK. But usually you will end up doing more than you expected you&#039;d do!  That&#039;s the magic!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this, James. Most of success is made from just regularly showing up whether you feel like it or not. Forming habits that if not completed it would seem strange. 

This year I have a mini habit of writing 100 words each day. Its great! I have lots of blogposts semi ready and starting to write an e-book. 

Thanks for your encouraging posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

This is a great post and serves as a powerful reminder that, completing the goal, not the process to the there, is at the front of my mind constantly. In the past year I have written six books...oh, and all of them are half completed. When I got bored or hit a wall with the writing, I started a new one. I always [felt] that boredom was a cue to move onto something else. and then something else. Eventually a person&#039;s workspace becomes a &quot;graveyard&quot; for unfinished projects and discarded goals from past resolutions and dreams that never made it past the first few stages. Will definitely try to correct this and stay focused on the &quot;process.&quot; A great reminder!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, you make an excellent point about the distinction between process and event. I can see this as the potential downside to motivation provided by goals (i.e. working to meet the revenue goal is motivating but it begs the question of how to continue after the goal is met).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are so right and another point that would be great to add is that if look at things as an event, once you reach that event then nothing will make sense and you wouldn&#039;t know what goes next. That is why you have to fall in love with the process rather than the event.

This really helped me, thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a fantastic article. I played soccer once a week for 2 years, and I recall just a handful of fantastic performances in which I got a lot of praise but vast majority of performances where not anywhere near those peaks. I said it&#039;s because I got bored of doing and playing the same thing for so long, and now I am proved correct, that the passion and motivation was just a myth.]]></description>
