					<description><![CDATA[The universe works, and this article could not have come at a better time for me. 

My bullseye is to be the kind of person that keeps every promise he makes to himself and others. 

The corollary to that bullseye is to be the kind of person that persistently works toward the goals he sets for himself.

Next stop: Lead by example and be the change that I wish to see in the world. I.E. Arrange my life such that I am self-sufficient and need no income. Then invite others to join me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great topic! I recently went back to school and finished my degree in social work. I was motivated to start a new career based on helping people instead of making someone else a profit. Once I had achieved this goal though I started to feel restless again. My new bullseye is health and fitness. I quit smoking 3 weeks ago and have started working out and eating better too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I am working on becoming the type of person that has her finances in order&quot;
&quot;I am working on becoming the type of person that instead of complaining takes the initiative to change or improve whatever is bothering me&quot;
I used to be that woman that stared at the mirror feeling sorry for myself and would walk around thinking that fit and beautiful people were so lucky. That was the old me...I honestly can&#039;t remember when was last time I did that.  Since I decided to change my ways the mirror is a positive place where I get to check out my results, or just a whatever place where I go to see if my clothing matches and my eye shadow is even :D]]></description>

I love that bullseye, Mary Anne. Strength can take many forms, and no matter how you go after it I think you&#039;ll be well served.

p.s. Thanks for sharing. Feel free to drop a line here whenever you please. :)]]></description>
