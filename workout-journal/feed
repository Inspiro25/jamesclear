					<description><![CDATA[I looked at so many apps because the piece of paper my trainer gave is a pain in the butt to carry around!  When I read &quot;notebook&quot; something clicked and I made a notebook using Microsoft Onenote for my phone which syncs to my laptop.  It&#039;s pretty much what you do except I don&#039;t have another thing to keep track of and I put reminders in there to go the gym and to track this stuff.  Thanks for the great idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Meant to send this earlier: great post.

There is lots of raw!raw! stuff out there.  We all know we could do this better, allocate time for this better, scoreboard this better, manage email better, etc.

I really appreciated that you transparently shared HOW you do it.  That is where the magic happens: seeing how someone with discipline manages a task.

Thanks, it&#039;s appreciated.

Sure, it&#039;s your specific methodology and 112 people will say this is better or yea, but, etc.  In the end, you stood up &#038; said here is how I do it.  

Cool.  We like it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr Clear,

I am from Mauritius and it&#039;s been a while that I have been reading your Monday and Thursday articles. The fact that I continue reading your articles means that I do agree with your views and appreciate your writing.

However, I could not share your views on the present article and I wanted to voice out my views to you as soon as I read the article. And then, I read the comments of others on the same article... most of them being from the european world and were very happy with your views, I thought it was a CULTURAL habit for you to keep a count on your leisure activities. What I mean is that for me, indulging in sport activities if it is not professional-wise, then it is a hobby, a past-time, something pleasureable, that I LOVE doing and there is no need to keep a count. I just like doing it, so I do it... the fact that I love doing it, progress will surely come and the day I stop doing it, it will be more because I am not interested rather than the other reasons that we usually come by. 

So, reading the comments posted theirein, I refrained from sending the above views of looking at sports as leisure and taking pleasure in doing it.

However, today, I read your article on FORGET ABOUT SETTING GOALS, and I must say, I am more agreeable to your views and I think this is where I can reconcile with you. Goal is important to make progress but systems are more important and even indispensable.

Leaving you with some food for thought... if you have not already done so.

Please keep writing... it is really appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use the app &quot;Bodyspace&quot;.  It gives you different programs to choose from so there is no wasting time when you go to the gym. Just hit the day you want to track and you are good to go. It&#039;s so simple to record weight and reps. Just enter in right after you complete the set. This keeps track of of which set you are on. Can&#039;t remember what you did for weight on this exercise last time, just click on history of exercise and instantly gives you what weight you did last time. Want to know your one rep maximum. click on one rep max in that exercise. If you want to substitute another shoulder exercise than the one in the program click on shoulder exercises. It will give you up to 50 different exercises to choose from. Don&#039;t know how to do that exercise? Click on the video and it shows you how to do it. At the end of the workout it adds up sets, reps and the amount of weight you just pushed. Go to your history and find out how much weight you&#039;ve pushed overall throughout the entire program. I never worked out consistently for my 40 years. I found this app and now I workout five times a week. I am now going into my 16th week of working out consistently and I am on my second program. This app keeps track of everything. Best thing about it is I waste no time at the gym thinking about what I&#039;m going to do or writing stuff down. My workouts are done in about an hour. This is an awesome workout app, I would highly recommend checking it out.

Cheers,

Brent]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

This is useful. 

I attended your strength training webinar and you had given the links to books, websites, etc. But I want to know from you if you have a SIMPLE weekly program for a beginner with easy to do exercises -- few and simple so that I can stick to it when I begin.

Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, thanks for the tip!
Was looking for a low-fi way to record workouts as don&#039;t want to use an app.
Bought a notebook yesterday and tried it today down at the gym and already can see the positives for using this system.

Thanks :-)

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the recommendation.

My problem is that im lazy. :@

Lazy to go to the gym even if I already have a membership. I can come out and make a list of reasons (excuses) not to go to the gym, like I&#039;m full, I&#039;m hungry, I&#039;m tired, I need to clean, I need to rest, I&#039;m sleepy, I&#039;m sick, I forgot my tennis shoes and on and on.... Haha.

I like the way you write. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/workout-journal#comment-12332&quot;&gt;Ryan Fuse&lt;/a&gt;.

Each vertical line signals the completion of one set. Say you&#039;re doing 5 sets of 3 reps. I pick up the weight, do 3 reps, put the weight back, and make a tally mark. It&#039;s just a quick way of marking, &quot;1 set down, 4 to go.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hear, hear!  My alteration is a post workout weight recording that I feed into a GoogleDoc so I can track it over time.  I&#039;m visual so the line graph is more impactful for me.

My notebook is pocket-sized, spiral bound and has a holster for a very tiny pen.  When I write with it, I feel like a giant...though it&#039;s tougher to write when I have post-heavy-lift shakey-hands.]]></description>
