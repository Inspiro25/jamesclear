					<description><![CDATA[Great, short, and simple article James :) Its to-the-point and direct to say the notion &quot;like a scientist&quot;. A scientist isn&#039;t doing experiments to show off, he is simply seeking the &quot;truth&quot;. No matter how that truth comes or after what kind of effort, tbouvht, study, or tial and error. Its a great way to approach life indeed. However it&#039;s amazing how societies make a lot of deama instead!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/failure-scientist#comment-7695&quot;&gt;Mary V&lt;/a&gt;.

Haha thanks for reading my comment.


I like bloggers like James here and other personal development bloggers (eg. Amit Amin) who provide practical ideas to improve lives and not just personal tale of triumph. They inspire you and at the same time they guide you on how to really improve life. 

Narcissistic tales?

Haha it can either be narcissistic or just an effort by the writer to convince people that it&#039;s possible to improve ourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really good perspective to have and something that I haven&#039;t been keeping in mind lately. My new job requires me to engaging and always on my toes in ways that I am not so used to doing. It&#039;s a wonderful opportunity for growth, but I bum myself out whenever I confuse my failures with who I am. Thanks for the reminder!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing knowledge just like always. 

I&#039;ve always thought of failure as an experiment. However, I&#039;m wondering if you use a framework that to run those experiments and iterate fast?

You answer is very much appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a scientist and engineer in an R&#038;D position, I can&#039;t agree with this sentiment enough. At work, so many times we try something we are convinced is going to work and solve a problem we&#039;ve been having and so many times we are wrong. But every time we do run an experiment, we go in with the strategy of making sure that we will learn something either way. Either we fix what we are looking to fix, or we learn more about why it&#039;s not working and use that to guide our next experiment. 

I didn&#039;t realize how much I applied this way of thinking to my life until you mentioned it here. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t agree with this analogy. You cannot fail an experiment the way it was mentioned in the post. Proving a hypothesis wrong isn&#039;t failure, it&#039;s a success. I would like to see how a scientist would deal with really failing an experiment, i.e. if he mixed more of one acid then he should have, and caused a disaster. That would be a real failure. If you do an experiment, and the outcome isn&#039;t what you predicted, I don&#039;t think that is a failure. Maybe that&#039;s the point, not getting what you want, but again that would drive any scientist mad.

Sorry for posting this negative feedback. I would like to add that I like and agree with all of the posts you made so far, but this one didn&#039;t go well with my thoughts and being in the mentioned profession I had to express what&#039;s on my mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The scientific method never proves anything right. It can prove a hypothesis wrong, and that is what guides the design of an experiment. A negative result reveals that you need to change your hypothesis, and devise a model that explains all of the data, including your most recent failure. In this way, you learn more from a negative result than a positive result, and it pushes you to develop a stronger hypothesis that is closer to the truth.

In the context of something like trying to build a new habit, let&#039;s say you make an attempt and it doesn&#039;t stick. That&#039;s great! What didn&#039;t work with the last attempt, and what should you change on the next attempt that might be more successful?]]></description>
