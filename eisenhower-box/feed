Dear Filip,

There is only one thing needed for successful, and some understood that in the first time or some in a different and more repetitive way. This article may not helped you but in this whole world even a single person is benefitted, that&#039;s great. James writes for himself not for us, so keep him writing. Start acting instead of reading too much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This article couldn&#039;t have come at a better time! Thank you. Too often I find myself rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. I know I&#039;m tricking myself because it feels like I&#039;m being productive, but I&#039;m not taking actionable steps toward accomplishing the most important tasks on my to-do list.

I hope the Eisenhower Box works for me! I&#039;ll start implementing it soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Killer post, James.  The Eisenhower box / matrix is emerging as the central element of our new marketing plan.  When we talk about &quot;consistently doing what matters most&quot;, people lock up.  

They know what matters most, but they don&#039;t know what to consistently do.  They also don&#039;t know how to do those things consistently...which forms the basis for our whole value propsition.  

Showing the matrix and saying, &quot;we help you develop quadrant 2 habits&quot; somehow seems to make it more tangible.

Love that Tim Ferriss quote about busyness, too.  

Keep it up!]]></description>
