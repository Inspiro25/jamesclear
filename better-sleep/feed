					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Great article. Yet one has to imbibe the teaching of your other articles for this to make sense. This article has the tone of steering towards achieving maximum productivity via optimum sleep. However, your articles on stressing on the system and not the goal contradicts the need for productivity. I think one should take a holistic approach to reading your articles for it to make sense.

Thanks,
Srikant]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, your writing underscores the sleep problem in a memorable way:

&quot;Without the slow wave sleep and REM sleep phases, the body literally starts to die.&quot;

Yikes! I&#039;m interested in improving sleep and the connection to a productive early morning ritual.]]></description>

I&#039;m also in Japan. I had someone tell me about this book they read about getting stuff done. Basically, you were supposed to wake up at 2 am every day (but still go to bet at a normal time). They genuinely believed it was a good idea; and I assume others do too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved reading this. It was especially interesting within the context of teaching English in Japan (I&#039;m teaching English in Japan, not James Clear). Most teenagers are expected to stay up late every night studying (until 12 or 1 is not unusual). I&#039;m also on a split schedule (teach mornings, then come back in the afternoon and teach until 9:30); so I&#039;m excited to learn more about how I can make the most of my sleep.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

I just came across this Article and to say this is the best article I have read related to improving Sleep Patterns. 

I do a Night Shift Job and have been doing so for the past 15 years. I find it difficult sleeping in the day time and end up with a maximum of 3-4 hours of sleep every day. Do I have a choice to take an alternative day shift Job, I would say not for the next 5 years. 

What would you suggest on improving sleep patterns for people who work in the nights Shift like myself

Regards,
Thomas]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very useful information, thank you so much. I live in Japan and I was surprised to see people sleeping on buses and trains, the library seemed like a sleep center rather than a learning center. Slowly, though, and with the help of the information here I understand why, they get so little sleep. For instance, a few people I know go to sleep at 1 a.m. or later and get up at 6, or even earlier. I think there is a cultural stigma attached to having a good sleep in this country - which is fascinating. My probably is trying to get to bed earlier, I heard that 10 was the best time but I go to sleep around 12 ish. Thank you for this page. Will check in regularly.]]></description>
