					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

As said in the email to you about this article:

It is important to have your daily decision making guided and in-line with your core personal values.

However, I have found that what I initially &#039;perceived&#039; as my core values were not always in line with my life goals and pursuit of what I have defined as my life&#039;s purpose.

It therefore becomes important to review your perceived values and eliminate the ones that are not helping to achieve your life goals and add some new ones that do, i.e. make your daily choices guided by your personal values and CHOOSE YOUR VALUES in-line with your life goals in pursuit of your life&#039; vision and mission.

Choosing the right personal values will help making the right decisions directed toward your goals in every day living.  These decisions will then drive the actions to allow you to change your habits and remove/re-program possible beliefs that are preventing you to achieve your life goals.

Also - as we and the environment around us evolve over time, an ongoing review of your purpose in life, life goals, your actions and habits, personal beliefs and core values, is important to successfully navigate the changing seas of daily life.

Hope this resonates with you and your audience.

Kind regards,

Gunther]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James: I just found this in an email that has been sitting in my inbox for months. Thanks again. 

This so hits a nerve. I can only agree with everything you&#039;re saying. Can I use your statement as a blueprint for my own mission statement? Can I quote you on this? We run a design and branding firm and I want to pretty much talk about the same, purpose over money, higher standards over shortcuts, etc.

PS. Your work is so inspiring. 
Thank you.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James, 

The amount of self-reflection you bring to the table with this article is remarkable and I would like to strive for that myself in the future. 

Please keep on doing your thing and writing with passion and validity about the daily issues that we all face. I have only been subscribed to your newsletter for a couple of months now but I truly enjoy your insights on life and how to improve status quo. As you I am a weightlifter going on ten years now and doing a master&#039;s in International Business with a passion for travelling so I can relate to your choice of topics almost every time. 

All the best from Denmark, 
Lars]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much. I am sometimes averse to focusing on measure, measure, measure, thinking so much of value (and values) can&#039;t be measured.

But, you just showed me how.....

Amazing!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a young singer/songwriter I find this post extremely helpful. The industry is ever evolving and it will take a new kind of artist to reach the masses. The traditional system is shifting... which is exciting. Integrity is so easy to pass over in the entertainment business... but strong integrity is like a lighthouse. Thank you for this honest insight. Excited to keep following along with you!]]></description>

Beautiful, Reuben! 

I spent a year living in Wellington, NZ, and became a huge fan of the Maori culture. You just boosted my admiration even higher. 

Thanks for sharing.

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice article. It&#039;s inspiring and refreshing to see someone setting this kind of standards for themselves. 

I especially like the idea of the week-long retreat. Too many times we get discouraged by the limited impact we think we can have on the world around us. Being together with people who share high values and truly care about making AND being a positive change can motivate us and help us overcome our doubts.]]></description>
