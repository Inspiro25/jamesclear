Hi Duff! I think your comment helps to challenge the ideas in the article, and is thought-provoking, but I strongly disagree with one thing: I firmly believe that it is not possible a successful athlete thinks his running “sucks”! I experienced running a bit before, and you can’t possibly finish correctly a race thinking you sucks… From my point of view, the key for improvement is to think “I can do better”, but to overcome challenges, you also need to think “I can do it” or “I’m doing okay” (considering your actual level). Because looking down on yourself will make you think more easily that you are not made for running, and you will give up when you finish last in a race, instead of thinking “okay, this time, I manage to finish the race, next I’ll try to catch up with the pack” and continue your training. I hope my writing is not too confused…]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, 

I totally agree with you. If you want to be some kind of person or if you want to achieve success in life , you should have that kind of habits in your everyday&#039;s life.

For example, you want to win marathon but you don&#039;t have confidence or belief that it is possible. WHY? Because running is not your daily habit. Maybe, you ran 2 years ago for 5 minutes and then you gave up . So, first you need to give PRIORITY to form habit as runner if you want to participate in marathon.DON&#039;T think about result or performance or win the marathon now, just concentrate on building the habit as a daily runner. FIRST, MAKE YOUR IDENTITY. If you think about your performance , result or outcome you may give up. 

For example, I was not exercising everyday. But , after that , i started to run for only 5 minutes everyday  which was possible for me. I tried to think about  my identity , not my performance . I was happy  that at least i had running habit in my life. After two months, my friends  gave me an identity as a RUNNER who ran everyday . Identity gives you confidence , So  first build up the identity  by setting daily habits and then think about building your performance ,if you want.]]></description>

With regards to the runner, the real challenge comes when she sets a 5k goal to run in under 25 minutes and fails.

If she has a fixed mindset she might blame the weather conditions, or say &quot;I guess I&#039;m not a runner after all.&quot;

If she has a growth mindset she&#039;ll instead focus on how specifically she can improve: &quot;I need to up my weekly mileage and add some sprints twice a week. And maybe I should join that weekly running club so that I&#039;ll be pushed to run faster.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset#comment-1620&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, it is a bit confusing--I&#039;m trying to understand and apply it myself. I read Dweck&#039;s more scientific book Self Theories (highly recommended) and I&#039;m not Dweck, so I&#039;m just giving my interpretation of what I read.

According to what I read in Self Theories, Dweck begins by trying to figure out why some students give up when they encounter challenges (&quot;helpless orientation&quot;) and others persist or even revel a challenge (&quot;mastery orientation&quot;).

Surprisingly, her and her colleagues found that a helpless orientation was not due to a lack of belief in one&#039;s abilities, nor was a helpless orientation only found in poor students. In fact, many top students had a helpless orientation. For instance, a high performing math student with a helpless response pattern may report agreement with a statement like &quot;I am good at math&quot; as long as the math tests are easy, and yet when they encounter a difficult math problem, they give up...and oddly their attitude also changes, often attributing their failure to their own inability (&quot;I suck at math&quot;), or blaming the teacher, etc.

By contrast, a poor math student with a mastery orientation might strongly disagree with the statement &quot;I am good at math,&quot; yet when encountering a difficult problem (for instance something they haven&#039;t been taught yet), they will persist and sometimes even figure it out.

Helpless responses to challenges seem to be due to holding what in the literature is called an &quot;entity theory&quot; about the self--that is to say, belief that intelligence (or some other ability or attribute like math ability, physical strength, personality, etc.) is basically fixed and easily determined by a single test or example.

By contrast, mastery responses to challenges seem to be due to holding what is called an &quot;incremental theory&quot; about the self--basically that abilities like intelligence can be improved with effort and good strategies.

In fact, students with an incremental theory think that working hard *is* intelligence...whereas students operating from within an entity theory think that working hard is for morons and chumps, and that smart people should be able to get the right answer quickly and without working too hard.

In addition there is another distinction here, that of a performance goal orientation vs. a learning goal orientation. This brings us to your example of the runner Leah.

A learning goal orientation is when a person pursues a goal to learn and get feedback that helps build competence in an area. A performance goal orientation is when a person seeks to demonstrate competence, preferring positive feedback and wanting to avoid negative feedback — in other words, they want to look good! A learning goal orientation is associated with an incremental theory and a mastery response to challenges, whereas a performance goal orientation is associated with an entity theory and a helpless response to challenges.

In the long run, a learning goal orientation will increase skills whereas a performance goal orientation will stall out one&#039;s progress.

I assume Leah was focused on not just getting out and running, but also getting feedback and learning from her runs so she could improve, but not in order to say to the world &quot;Look how fast I ran today!&quot; but to maybe run a little more smoothly and a bit faster day by day, or maybe ease up a bit on days when it got hard, etc., in order to build competence at running. But I&#039;m concerned that if she focuses too much on the identity &quot;I am a runner&quot; then this may actually *decrease* her performance. But it might not--an occasional focus on performance won&#039;t necessarily hurt a learning goal orientation/incremental theory.

Here&#039;s an example: one day I was squatting in the gym (I&#039;m not the strongest man by any means, but I enjoy exercising). An obviously fit woman asked how many more sets I had and as I had just begun my first warmup set I said it would be a while, but she could work in with me if she wanted. She replied, &quot;well you are much taller than me,&quot; which was true, &quot;and you probably are a lot stronger than me too,&quot; which I immediately thought was probably *not* true.

In that moment I felt myself get psyched out. I was doing a 5x5 program and I totally wimped out on my 5th rep of each set, failing to hit even what I had done in the previous week. And I had just been reading Dweck so I knew what had happened--this young woman&#039;s compliment &quot;you are probably a lot stronger than me&quot; temporarily put me into an entity theory. Rather than focusing on working hard and keeping good form, I gave up early and I allowed my form to become compromised.

In terms of the habits of a champion, those are certainly important to practice on a regular basis. And yet there are two kinds of champions: those with a fixed mindset and those with a growth mindset. The champion attitude in my opinion is that of the growth mindset. Growth mindset folks are less concerned about identity and more interested in how they can apply themselves and what they can learn to overcome obstacles and improve their abilities in a given area. Even after reaching elite status they might still think they suck! Confidence in one&#039;s abilities and an identity as an expert is not necessarily correlated with a growth mindset.]]></description>
