					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/make-things#comment-4401&quot;&gt;Raine Black&lt;/a&gt;.

Raine, I am so sorry you had that experience, though grateful you survived it. I&#039;ve been there myself and wouldn&#039;t even wish it on an enemy. I came across a couple of sayings on Google+, both of which made a lot of sense to me and I thought might help you as well:

1) When someone judges you, it isn&#039;t actually about you. It&#039;s about them and their own insecurities, limitations and fears.

AND

2) Whenever someone undermines your dreams, predicts your doom, or criticizes you in any way, remember, they&#039;re telling you their story, not yours. 

I have a couple outspoken, judgmental family members whom I love dearly, in spite of their tendency to criticize harshly &quot;for my own good&quot; - their claim, not mine. I find that by remembering the above sayings (and James&#039;s wonderful articles) I am able to check my temper, and not take what they say personally. In fact, with practice, I&#039;m becoming rather adept at seeing that they typically attack when they feel threatened by something I&#039;ve done or said. These days, instead of becoming sad or angry and defensive, I&#039;m able to outwardly smile and thank them for their input, while inwardly feel a bit sorry for the rut they seem to be stuck in. Surprisingly, I&#039;ve discovered that sometimes their comments weren&#039;t completely wrong, even if their delivery was.  

I hope I never wallow in superiority, but I feel so much more free and alive than I did when I took what they said so much to heart. I only hope that some day they can conquer their own fears enough to finally allow their minds and lives to blossom and grow without the stultifying effects of judgment. Whether they do or don&#039;t though is their choice. I&#039;ve made mine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If you choose to create something, you’ve already won because you haven’t rejected yourself.&quot; - James Clear.

Mr. Clear, allow me to be very clear, you are truly a magnificent writer. I personally love your work, and I fell as though I am obliged to spread to word that there is a man who knows the secrets of how to make every day a winning day! I am merely writing this comment, in hopes that you will read it, and give me some feed back as to WHAT MAY I DO to benefit your success as YOU HAVE BENEFITED MINE!

P.S. I will make it a habit to share your articles on Twitter.

Thank you,
Chris Ascencio]]></description>
