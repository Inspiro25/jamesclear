					<description><![CDATA[James, this is a great idea. Your application for the corporate world (Want to be taken seriously at work?, Identity: become the type of person who is always on time., Small win: Schedule meetings with an additional 15–minute gap between them so that you can go from meeting to meeting and always show up early.)

Can you suggest a way to apply it to the following goal: &quot;earn a living through selling digital products / Internet entrepreneurship.&quot; 

I&#039;m thinking of &quot;writing 100 words of content&quot; each day (either for my blog, for guests posts or products). Does that make sense as a small win? If not, what do you recommend?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article James, thank you.  I loved hearing you say take &quot;incredibly small steps.&quot;  So often we hear the advice to take &quot;massive action&quot; and after years of trying and failing at this I have accidentally been coming to the realization that the only that HAS worked for me all these years were the small steps I was taking.  It was so good to hear you confirm it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

It&#039;s a fantastic post when we all nearing the new year where everyone takes resolution based on performance and appearance. Since I am a full time trader I always look into my performance and results rather than on my trading habits. This gives me a huge boost to look after my identity based habit which can lead to good performance in the upcoming year.

Thank you.

Regards,
John]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

Just wanted to say thanks for your inspirational blog.  I subscribed to your weekly email about a month ago and have just been so impressed by your writings.  I find them incredibly wise, practical and based on timeless principles.  I&#039;m sharing them at night with my 11 y/o daughter who is an aspiring violinist.

Your writings have served as a springboard for some productive discussion with her!

Thanks again,
Kyle]]></description>
