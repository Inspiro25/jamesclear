					<description><![CDATA[Must say, I hate coming to the comments every time and then reading through stupid &quot;thank you&quot; comments just in a search of interesting addition to the article. Yes, the article is very good, thank you, but please -- maybe you will somehow delete the tons of &quot;thank you&quot; that make it impossible to find really interesting comments? Just maybe add some &quot;thank you button&quot; -- so the people who just have urge to act will just make a click and will not produce tons of empty sentences. Ha? Please!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently read that persistence outweighs intelligence by a factor of two, meaning that someone who puts in the hours of beating on his craft but has no natural skill at it will outperform the naturally gifted person who doesn&#039;t practice. 

Often parents praise children for their intelligence and talents whilst they should praise their determination and work-ethic instead. 

Just my two cent$]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/threshold-theory#comment-11865&quot;&gt;Binh&lt;/a&gt;.

So many people wait until somebody passes the ball. (Not just in basketball.) What if that day never comes? Studying is preparation. But preparation alone won&#039;t you get the ball.

Don&#039;t wait until you get the ball.
Don&#039;t wait until you get a raise.
Don&#039;t wait until you get asked for a date.

You have to go for it yourself.

(And maybe you fail and try again. And again - again and again. Until you finally succeed. This is called practice... and nothing in the world can take its place.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Terman study and the literature on extreme ability are misunderstood in this article. Looking at rates of invention, discovery, and success higher IQ continues to give strong gains as high as you go. But in a roughly Gaussian distribution the number of people at a given level falls off super-exponentially. I.e. the more able you are, the better your chances, but the number of people at high ability levels falls off a lot faster than their per person chances improve, so most successful people are not at the extremes.

http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2014/07/success-ability-and-all-that.html

As Hsu says:

&quot;In the SMPY study probability of having published a literary work or earned a patent was increasing with ability even within the top 1%. The &quot;IQ over 120 doesn&#039;t matter&quot; meme falls apart if one measures individual likelihood of success, as opposed to the total number of individuals at, e.g., IQ 120 vs IQ 145 who have achieved some milestone. The base population of the former is 100 times that of the latter!&quot;]]></description>
