					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,

That post resonates so much with me. I had to learn this the hard way. Growing up with a value system that only who works himself to near death is a worthy human being, I never respected my boundaries for years. Last year I hit bottom rock after an extremely stressful working period of 5 weeks. Project was done and time for celebration had come, but instead the only thing I managed was to lie down in my bed with the blanket up to my nose, freezing, weak, and totally burned out. For one solid week I could do nothing else than stare at the ceiling while I had the feeling of being surrounded by cold, heavy, grey fog, like a heavy blanket of grey mass coming down upon me.

This has been the most horrid experience in my life and I never ever want to return to this point. I&#039;m still struggling with my old behavioural pattern but this experience has taught me to refrain from responsibilities I don&#039;t want to have and to say &#039;no&#039;. The thing I&#039;ve learned is that a valuable and responsible human being first takes care of herself in order to do good work and in order to not let others down (like they teach us in the airplane before take-off. ;) ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Outstanding. I&#039;m in the middle of writing an article on budgeting your energy that fits in well with this.

My wife and I are very different. She&#039;s an introvert and home-maker (she&#039;s makes the heck out of our home) and I&#039;m a weird mixed extrovert who likes to make up for the energy I spend with small groups of people by being alone or working.

We both handle our refills very differently, and we&#039;ve realized that we have to be more serious about the care with which we follow a budget for our energy so we can be the most loving and effective people to each other and our children. We would wing it for years, but we&#039;d experience this cumalative stress shutdown and find ourselves reeling from the experience for weeks.

It&#039;s hard to admit that we&#039;re limited people, but obviously we are. I&#039;m hoping that as I mature into my late thirties this will begin to stick even more.

Great articles and reminders on these issues. I&#039;m really thankful for them.

Happy Thanksgiving!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Makes me happy to see the stress on working out... the Smolov is tough! But do-able. You&#039;ll feel so accomplished once you&#039;ve finished, with insane strength afterwards.

Keep up the intensity in your training.

Balance is key, thanks for the good read.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice metaphor ,

I reminds me of the effects of alcohol. 

If you have a hangover you need time to recuperate, lots of water and rest.  A hangover once a year is not problem.  You  will loose some time, productivity but you have  enjoyed had a nice evening.  

If you have a drinking problem water and rest will not solve it. You need something else.  The cumulative effect is devastating. 

The cumulative effect is also an excellent force.

					<description><![CDATA[James,

This couldn&#039;t be more accurate in our work practices of today, constantly online, on phone or on something.

I recently finished in hospital for a few days due to stress related issues arising from a disfunctional work environment.

My friends and family couldn&#039;t understand why the particular issue had &quot;got to me&quot; as I usually have powered through similar issues in the past.

The fact is the bucket was empty, no more fight left.

Back on track now. Great article, thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this post! And I&#039;ve been doing too many set of &quot;squats&quot; in building my new business. I am learning what I can schedule and be OK, and realizing what 1 meeting will push me over the edge. In my excitement to get things moving, I can end up stopped in my tracks. This weekend I got a virus and have had to cancel a speaking engagement for tomorrow. Not what I wanted to do! But it can be rescheduled and I can continue learning to take better care of me. Thanks, James Clear!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anytime I hear someone speak in terms of buckets... I&#039;m reminded of a book we read to our kids, &quot;How Full is Your Bucket?&quot; by Tom Rath and Mary Rechmeyer (2009).  It&#039;s a very short but insightful read.  The story focuses on how our actions and interactions - both positive and negative have an impact on the contents of our buckets...  a great reminder to us as parents and our kids to reflect on whether we&#039;re adding or taking away from each other.  Runs parallel with your concept of cumulative stress...  check it out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The bucket stays fuller longer when it is properly balanced. The last five years of my life have been out of whack -- increasing debt, unstable income, 18-hour workdays, demanding employers -- and I have often ignored my health and happiness just to keep hearth and home together. I thought once things got better (as they have) I&#039;d immediately feel better, but that ain&#039;t so, and now I realize why. I need to make a concentrated effort to refill my bucket (and hope it has not got a hole in it!). Thanks Mr. Clear, for the clarity.]]></description>
