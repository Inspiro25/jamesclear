					<description><![CDATA[Not responding to e-mails until noon is great advice but difficult to do in today&#039;s corporate world.  I tried not responding until 10 a.m., but my boss received complaints that I was not responding quickly enough.  So, I had to go back to responding immediately.

The increasing volume of communication and the expectation of immediate response has created a workplace that emphasizes urgent tasks.  For many, the only time they have for important, longer term work is after business hours or on weekends.   

Although delaying response to e-mails until noon will be impossible for many, it is certainly worthwhile to try this or suggest this at work, perhaps on a more limited scale.  Most businesses could increase productivity greatly if even a small amount of uninterrupted time for important tasks were made available.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so real, James.

Creative work first, reactive work later is going to have to be my mantra for the coming year. Let&#039;s see how it goes. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this article (of course I&#039;m reading it from my email, before noon)!  A question:  do you work out before noon?  I find that if I do, it cuts into my creative time.  But I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s best to work out in the morning if I want to be sure it gets done.  It would be great to hear how you approach this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right on! One name psychologists use for that nagging effect an unfinished task on our psyche is &quot;The Zeigarnik Effect.&quot; She discovered that a finished task has no effect, but one that&#039;s unfinished causes our unconscious mind to ping our conscious mind like a little kid reminding his mother to stop at McDonald&#039;s on the way home. Here&#039;s an article I wrote on the topic that adds this dimension: http://www.2time-sys.com/2013/06/17/emails-impact-on-our-stress-levels/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard the &quot;don&#039;t check your e-mail first thing&quot; advice many times and it&#039;s a non starter for me.  I always check my email first thing in the morning. I often work with people in earlier timezones so it&#039;s less productive for everyone if I wait until &quot;their&quot; afternoon. However I usually close down e-mail after about 30-40 minutes and then tackle the first big task.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a night person and I&#039;m a writer so I do this in reverse. A lot of days I don&#039;t touch email until 10am or 11am but it&#039;s always the first thing I do because I&#039;m still sluggish at that time. I get all the business aspect of writing finished during the day and when night comes my brain wakes up and I start writing. It&#039;s then that I ignore email and Facebook and the notifications that continually pop up. So this can work for us night owls as well.]]></description>
