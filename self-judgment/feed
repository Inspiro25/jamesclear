					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice and surprising that you have been coming out with articles that some tiny X like me is able to relate to and thus get connected.

Sorry about the BIG comment that follows. This is after 3 months of following your articles.

Small variant of &quot;Release the desire to define yourself as good or bad&quot;: I have been comparing myself as BAD compared to 3 of my colleagues who are GOOD. These 3 are CRITICAL RESOURCES in my office. Now, I will do this (I am an IT Consultant): I will compare how BAD I was with my previous me. I am less BAD now. BAD coefficient has come down and GOOD coefficient has gone up.

Thanks for your wonderful article. Of course, your previous ones are wonderful too.

Though I have not commented on your previous ones, just wanted to pen down my thoughts this time. Thanks a lot. Your articles are thought provoking and practical. Not sure how you manage to get ideas which can be implemented!

I got hooked to them after my Martial Arts instructor posted one of them in Facebook (article on Cumulative Stress). I was able to connect to this article after I was down with high fever for a week. This was after weeks of work and sleepless nights.

I have been putting your ideas into practice since the time I started following your articles. For e.g., 
1) Finland&#039;s Sisu is a definite inspiration. Though we know that we have to be tough, we go back. This time, there is something I can connect to when I go back (I had a very bad time at office last year).
2) &quot;How Constraints Make You Better&quot;: This applied to me as lot of my time goes to my kid at home. I am getting better with this constraint and other constraints.
3) I am also getting better with my priorities as said in &quot;Warren Buffett&#039;s 2 List Strategy&quot;
4) &quot;Time Assets vs. Time Debts&quot;: My Productivity is increasing after applying this formula.

Etc. The list goes on.

Thanks for inspiring us.]]></description>

Thank you and keep sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really great. As a music producer I constantly find myself judging my work and comparing it to already successful Soundcloud artists, which leads me to feeling unsatisfied with my work. But I realize I&#039;m focusing on the wrong thing, the process is what matters, doing the work day in, day out.

I&#039;m very interested in reading &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot; now, it seems like a great read. 

Thank you for sharing this, James.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, 

Normally I lurk across your site &quot;every now and then&quot; (it&#039;s one of my few bookmarks, just to make sure I&#039;m keeping up with you every couple months) but I had to stop in to say something very simple about this article: you are doing a GREAT job, and the work you are doing IS changing people&#039;s lives for the better.  

For example, a while back you wrote about building up your pushups, with the main gist about making it your goal &quot;to become the type of person that consistently trains for pushups,&quot; rather than &quot;to be able to do 50 pushups by the end of the month.&quot; Going pretty much off that thought alone, I&#039;ve run more in the last two months than I had in the last 5 years combined, and written almost 10k words for a website I&#039;d love to work for.  That might turn into more than a hobby, too, because I wrote for myself at first and wrote prolifically enough to get my foot in the door.  It sounds eerily like what you described here, which is really encouraging to me!  

If any of that&#039;s incorrect or not &quot;quite&quot; what you were saying, it&#039;s cool.  I don&#039;t peg you as someone who nitpicks over the details of positive change (I&#039;ll take it when and where I can get it!)  I only read the pushups article one time and browsed some others through the year.  That&#039;s all it took for those few thoughts to stick with me, almost to a daily, meditative extent. So, while I might not show up in your site&#039;s stats too much, rest assured the message is getting through.  Keep pounding on that door!

Here&#039;s to a great 2015 for everyone reading this (including the lurkers like me).

Will, Chicago]]></description>
