					<description><![CDATA[Loved the line &quot;If you want to bake a cake, then bake the damn cake. Don’t cook a chicken and yell at it for not being a fish.&quot; I can relate this to my efforts to follow a trading system as I kept hopping from one to another with no results. 

Your posts are so insightful. Thanks so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I love this analogy and post. It got me thinking about how long it can take to find results and how quickly they can go away. If I may crudely expand on your analogy: It may take 1 hour to bake the perfect cookie, but only 5 minutes eat them all and have nothing left to show for your work. This is like following the perfect workout plan for 12 weeks and then going on a drinking and eating binge for the holidays. If this happens and you expect to make more cookies (results) appear just as quickly as they disappeared, you don&#039;t have the right expectations and can get down on yourself easily. You have to go back through the process of following the recipe and being patient to get back to the results you want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First off big fan, I really enjoy your posts.

This post didn&#039;t quite do it for me. I mean not staying with something all the way through seems like a pretty straight forward concept. IMO the tough part is knowing when to stop, or knowing how to tweak your recipe. Would love to read a post that dives into those two concepts!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, like you, I absolutely loathe repeating things that do not work.  A lot of my energy is focused on finding these things and eliminating them.

This is a great reminder that although getting rid of the things that do not work it great, it is also important to make sure that the steps were followed properly.

Half assing, or going your own way will not give you a solid indication.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was teaching adults electronics. To overcome math weaknesses, I gave out a six step program on &quot;how to solve any math problem&quot;. They would do steps one and two, then jump to five and six. They would get the wrong answers all the time. People want results without doing the work. This is why success does not happen to everyone. What is the saying? &quot;If it was easy, everyone would be successful.&quot; You have to love the work. If you don&#039;t have the patience to do the work, try meditation. It will help develop long-term focus and endurance to see yourself get through the work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog and funny too.
Well it has finally happened.  With prayer and persistence (you are my task master) I finally have gotten a writing gig that pays! And not just one!  Also, with fear and trembling I went gluten free to see if this body and mind can be wrestled into a harmonious, happy, diligence.  Yes, hanging in there I cleared out all gluten and most other grains, got healthy substitutes, shed some weight and brightened my mind, mood and energy.  I have been working out steadily.  And, I have made some really great sales in my business.  

I really wanted to quit many times in this quest, it is hard to give up things you grow up with and old habits.  It is sort of like moving to a foreign place and having very little that is familiar to eat or do.  Everything changes.  But I could do it all and persist through the down times by holding an image of how happy I would be once these efforts met real success, and that really worked.  What&#039;s funny is that I sort of turn around backward and look at the strategy and the path I took and I realize I also had sort of a parallel self that had been so fearful all along the way and I had to keep telling her to stop being so afraid.  That worked too.
