					<description><![CDATA[My first article to read from James and I loved it. Very truthful, simple and productive. I spent 2 years in &quot;Motion&quot; preparing for my research subject and now its time to make an Action.

Thank you so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/taking-action#comment-1628&quot;&gt;Maggi&lt;/a&gt;.

There&#039;s a thought in psychology that kids who prefer just looking out the window turn out to be less active. So the point is to try and activate. 

However, it&#039;s not prohibited to use some shortcuts. I tried many diets and the only one working was Loaded Gun Diet, and it&#039;s because it demanded the least effort. I practically lost weight eating the same stuff just with a few rules.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I really like the essence of this article, especially the idea that the biggest reason why we slip into motion rather than taking action: we want to delay failure. 

And... I do still find that motion = action, although I can see that motion is activity without a direction whilst action has a direction or completion aspect to it, so I think for me the better distinction is being in motion vs completing actions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, fantastic article. It&#039;s interesting how easy it is to lose sight of the simplest, most obvious concepts. Thanks for bringing this back into my focus so I can consider how it affects my current procedures in my life. You are amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! Seeing things in Motion vs. Action perspective helped to get aware of things I do in my life. It&#039;s really easy to get stuck in motion. The worst part of it is that sooner or later you end up far away from action and motivation vanishes. Thanks for building awareness!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a great motivational article on how to distinguish action from motion. It really helped me see how easily we can think we are being productive but are in fact procrastinating or trying to avoid failure. The simple suggestions have got my wheels turning on how I can start reaching some personal goals again after some big changes in my life. I also found the following very helpful: http://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/family/teenagers/ask/stop-procrastinating/.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was whack on my head!

I have been applying that philosophy for my fitness regime but regarding my academics I was kinda stuck at the motion stage since last semester leading to procrastination.

Now I know what the deal is, so I can deal with it easily.

Thank you!!! :-B]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James I am a big fan of your book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/habits&quot; title=&quot;Transform Your Habits James Clear&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Transform Your Habits&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; It helped me implement and most importantly stick to some actions I wanted to take for a long time especially for my health!

After reading your article (motion vs action), I realized that I was using motion to procrastinate action. So my question for you today is this: Can you give us practical tips or exercizes to lessen the fear of rejection and failure so that it is easier for us to take action? Thanks again for your inspiring work! Keep writing!]]></description>
