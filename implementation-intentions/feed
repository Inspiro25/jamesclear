					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love this James! One thing I found out is that I like to examine the effectiveness of the system. It makes managing sessions of intensity a lot easier, while, at the same time, being procrastination-proof. 

Thanks for the excellent article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,  I love this post. I just rediscovered you again a couple weeks ago and have been lurking. Good to be here.

Anyway...I&#039;m a rock climber, guitar player, and love to workout. These are all activities that require a fair amount of discipline. It has always seemed odd to me that the days when I&#039;m really dragging ass and barely make it to the rocks/gym/practice...those are some of the most rewarding days I&#039;ve had.

I also liken this phenomena to people who don&#039;t do something because it&#039;s &quot;not their purpose&quot; in life. There a billion and one very valuable things a person could do with their time, and to not do them because they&#039;re not &quot;higher callings&quot; is such a shame.

Thanks for the thoughtful post, man! See you &#039;round.

					<description><![CDATA[Hiya James! New to your site. I came here by way of a recommendation from Steve Scott, in case you track such things.

This post of yours answered a question I didn&#039;t know I needed to pose: &quot;HOW do I stick with a new habit?&quot; I would highly recommend that you reprint or repackage this exact material for the upcoming New Year.

Just downloaded your eBook. Thanks for making it available free. Looking forward to see if the &quot;if-then&quot; plan indeed works for me. IF it does, THEN I&#039;ll come back and let you know. 

My new habit is to follow the steps in Steve&#039;s book: Internet Lifestyle Productivity. No, I&#039;m not an affiliate, just a pleased customer from Steve&#039;s other works so I&#039;m giving it a plug. Glad he recommended your site to me, planning to come back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James-

Great work full of sound principle and evidence.  You would no doubt appreciate the Dominican University study that also talked about the power of sharing your progress weekly as a major contributor to goal achievement.

We are working hard to harness these best practices in our simple performance and accountability app called irunurun.  I welcome your input on it.

If Aristotle was right, &quot;We are what we repeatedly do,&quot; we&#039;ve found that most people today neither know what to repeatedly do, nor do they do those things.  We believe a primary culprit is precisely because they rely too heavily on motivation and willpower...neither of which is consistent from one moment to the next.

Would love to share our findings from the study of elite soldiers, athletes, and leaders...and how they rely much more on purpose, focus, rhythm, and accountability to consistently do what matters most.  Perhaps there is some synergy there.

Thanks again! -Travis]]></description>
