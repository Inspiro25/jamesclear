					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

I first stumbled upon your blog when I was researching intermittent fasting. 

But this article nearly brought tears to my eyes. I&#039;m both new to writing (~ 3 years) and weight training (1 year), so it&#039;s really encouraging to read about how diligent, focused effort over time can result in amazing things happening.

Thank you for writing this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello James,

It was one of the best articles you have ever written! Thanks a lot, James, for giving such a great inspiration.

Minimum distraction, maximum potential. Many take away for our internet savvy generation from George R. R. Martin. :)

Thanks a lot again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this reading!

So true when you wrote so many people are expecting to gain success so quickly, &quot;overnight success&quot;, that they do not stop and think about all they have achieved so far. I am definitely guilty of that. 

We may all be only one door away from achieving our goal, but too many of us stop before even reaching there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome Read. This pretty much encapsulates all there is to succeed in any field and at any level. Nothing less. Nothing more. 

It also lends weight to the 10,000 hours rule for &#039;overnight success&#039; proposed by Malcolom Gladwell in his book &#039;Outliers&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article.... I loved this the most - &#039;The difference is that he didn’t let the urge for overnight success derail his commitment to daily work. The greatest display of patience is a continued commitment to the process when you’re not being rewarded for it yet.&#039;]]></description>
