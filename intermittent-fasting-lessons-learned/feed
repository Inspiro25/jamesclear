It could just be water weight. If you&#039;re eating below your maintenance calories, you will lose weight - period.

If you want to see how significant water weight is, try this. Weigh yourself now, fully hydrated. Then don&#039;t drink anything for a few hours (go to the bathroom as usual). Then do your usual 40 minute cardio session, grab a shower, pat yourself dry. You&#039;ll probably lose 2-3 lbs just like that. Weight is a terrible measure of body fat - if you want to lose body fat (the answer is &#039;yes&#039;, btw), then you need to eat below your maintenance calories.]]></description>

Probably 10% above maintenance on workout days, 20% below maintenance on rest days. Calculate maintenance based on your BMR multiplied by activity level. Do that and you&#039;ll gain strength and burn fat.]]></description>

Weight is dependent on calories. Check what your BMR is, multiplied by your activity level, and how many calories you&#039;re eating. As long as you&#039;re ~ 15-20% below, you will be losing weight. If you&#039;re GAINING weight, then you&#039;re either weighing yourself at inconsistent times, or you&#039;re not eating 15-20% below your maintenance calories. One or the other.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought that muscle was broken down on training days and built on resting days. If on the resting days you don&#039;t have enough calories how would your body build muscle? This does not make sense to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question on calories/carbs cycling. Does meal time matter?

I&#039;m an office worker and I work from 8-6pm and train in the evenings. I get the impression that you should eat and replenish nutrition AFTER a workout (it makes sense too since you deplete energy and &quot;damage&quot; muscles during the workout). 

So on my training days if I do a high calories/carbs diet, should I time them to eat the largest meal around my workout time?]]></description>

Stronglifts is a good program, but if you&#039;re going to fast for 24 hours, I would switch your strategy. Eat on the days you workout and fast on your rest days. That said, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary to fast 24 hours, multiple times per week. One 24-hour period per week, should be plenty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I found this very interesting as I am trying to look more lean and shredded and I have 10-15 lbs to go! I was wondering though, I am doing the Stronglifts 5x5 and I was wondering if it would be unwise to fast for 24 hours on weight train days and eat on non weight train days? Thanks so much for this page. I plan on fasting every second day if that&#039;s smart or should I do it only twice a week?]]></description>
