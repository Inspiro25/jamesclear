					<description><![CDATA[I have been working out with my own free weights and other minor home equipment at least 3 times a week for years now; this year I have taken on a version of Dean Ornish&#039;s Reversal Diet under the supervision of my holistic doctor who does blood draws about every 3 months or so.  He made it still more difficult at the beginning by denying most fruit and gluten.  I have since told him (after the 1st trimester) that I took back the gluten and some fruits (although I still try to limit my use of sweet ones like banana, pineapple).  I also have about an OZ of dark chocolate (70-90% cocoa)daily.  And I use the sweetener Stevia in my morning lime juice (and cocoa the few times I have made that with unsweetened almond milk).  I drink that milk or thinned V8 with meals and sometimes have a snack of 1/4 C of plain Greek Yogurt (Voskos is yummy).  I will put moderate amounts of low-fat meat and cheese in my meals after next February (1 year).  I need to find a site where I can search for a local lover by describing what I want of his anatomy.  I have been very good friends with someone very special and we were together last year (as I traveled for my daughter&#039;s 3rd wedding) and we enjoyed a better honeymoon (we think) than the kids.  I am still active in my arts and crafts (retired from engineering) with many friends but those other needs are deeper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/actions-instead-of-medications#comment-945&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

Great points, James!

When talking about health, the thing that matters in the end is results. And if the results are reached via some sort of placebo effect, I don&#039;t see anything wrong with that.

That is, as long as we understand and accept that it&#039;s a nurturing care, more time with the patients and positive affection that&#039;s working and not some sort of random &quot;chanting&quot; or &quot;calling your guardian angel&quot;.

When we understand this we can move forward and implement the aspects that work and discard what&#039;s not working.

&quot;more time with patients and showing them nurturing care — something that our medical system could use more of.&quot;

That&#039;s a very good point. We are often so obsessed with running everything as a business and forget that for something like health, aiming for highest revenue per hour or maximum clients served per hour is not necessarily the way to go, long term.

Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/actions-instead-of-medications#comment-953&quot;&gt;Andrew Yeh&lt;/a&gt;.

Andrew -- I think you&#039;re getting at an important point. Whether it be exercise or diet or simply taking an active interest in the patient&#039;s life ... the lack of time for many physicians strips this opportunity away. As you point out, this is one of the burdens that a large society places on healthcare practitioners.

Another important thing to note is that while doctor&#039;s get most of the press, it doesn&#039;t have to come down to the physician. There are plenty of other people in the system &#8212; nurses, physician&#039;s assistants, physical therapists, etc. &#8212; who can provide guidance and training on these topics as well. While doctors are pressed for time, there is no reason we can&#039;t build behavior change into the medical system somewhere.

Regardless, I think your underlying reasoning is on target: smaller and simpler societies have an easier time implementing time intensive changes than large societies do.

Thanks for reading! It&#039;s great to have you sharing your thoughts here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how society&#039;s attitude towards prescribing action versus prescribing medication differs with regards to societies.

My guess is that the more complicated and large a society (US), the more likely it&#039;ll be that medication is prescribed. And there would be good reasons for doctors to prescribe medication instead of action. There&#039;s less time and energy to devote to each patient in creating a good exercise program, and it&#039;s harder to make sure there&#039;s a follow-up visit which is important for a non-boolean, non-specific treament like action (is he only doing half? does he remember how many to do? when is he doing it?). 

Additionally, exercise programs are entirely under the control of the doctor. If a drug doesn&#039;t work, it&#039;s the drug&#039;s fault. But if an exercise program doesn&#039;t work, it&#039;s the doctor&#039;s fault.

By contrast, in a smaller country like, perhaps, Sweden (as mentioned in an earlier comment), the doctor has more time to figure out exactly what exercise program to assign to a patient and more of a chance to follow up.]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard similar things, Gabor. And while I&#039;m not sure if that particular business model would work in the US, this much is clear: our healthcare system should be incentivized to keep people healthy, not merely treat them when their ill. 

Thanks for reading and sharing your ideas. It&#039;s great to have you here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/actions-instead-of-medications#comment-937&quot;&gt;Erinn Clevinger&lt;/a&gt;.

Erinn -- thanks so much for sharing your story and your husband&#039;s experiences. I think they are the perfect complement to what I&#039;m talking about here. 

Two points I want to clarify...

First, I hope I didn&#039;t come across as saying that we should abandon all science-based treatment and medication. I think the best solution is a combination of these methods with the science of behavior change. Not all drugs are as great as they claim to be, but many of them are scientifically proven and I think we should keep using them. Additionally, even when behavior change is a good option I think that pharmaceuticals are a great way to get more immediate short-term results for patients while they work on building better long-term habits.

Secondly, you say that it&#039;s very easy to point to doctors as the problem. I agree with that, but I think it&#039;s just as easy to point to patients as the problem. I hear a lot of physicians (and nurses, physical therapists, etc.) complaining about their patients being non-complaint and not following directions. Rather than patients blaming doctors or doctors blaming patients, I&#039;d like to see more time and energy spent teaching and learning how to make positive long-term changes. When we spend all day tossing blame around, nobody benefits.

What&#039;s important is that no matter what side you fall on, you take responsibility for doing what you can to make healthy changes easier. For my part, I research the science of behavior change and do my best to share practical insights with readers. And if I end up becoming a physician in the near future, then I&#039;ll do my best to share similar insights with my patients. 

Many other people in our audience are doing better than I am -- they are practicing it in their own lives. Kim Bova, who commented above, is a good example of that. Your story about losing weight and taking your health into your own hands is in another great example. (Well done, by the way.)

Long story short, I think we (you, me and doctors like your husband) are all on the same team end of the day. We all want to help people live healthier and get the most out of life.

Thanks for sharing your story and taking the time to read! It&#039;s great to have you in our little community.]]></description>
