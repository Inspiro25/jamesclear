					<description><![CDATA[Great article James.  This got me thinking about musicians and producers.  It&#039;s often then musicians who listen to EVERYTHING and collaborate with artists way outside there genre (Kanye West + Paul Mccartney is a good recent example) that allows them to develop a unique framework which distinguishes there work so much.

I often fall into the trap of reading the same type of book (personal development, entreprenuership etc) and I&#039;m looking more into philosophy.  This has shown me that I need to go further than that and read stuff that will not seem relevant, but that likely has various linkages which will allow me to bring something new to the game!

Thanks again,

Peace,
Dubem]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/feynman-mental-models#comment-14156&quot;&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;.

Great points, Justin... Thank you.

Especially the part about being detached and learning from enemies. It&#039;s probably the most important but hardest part to follow...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James! Thank you so much for writing this! It&#039;s a good reminder that when we have tunnel vision on how to figure out a problem then things will always be done the same way and won&#039;t grow and expand! I&#039;m planning on reading a bunch of books I haven&#039;t ever thought of reading this year - The Omnivore&#039;s Dilemma being one of them. I really appreciate your emails and I look forward to reading more this following year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/feynman-mental-models#comment-14151&quot;&gt;Vishal&lt;/a&gt;.

Something tangenitally relevant to human psychology? Hmm...
Marketing.
Acting.
Books on characterization / writing out actions.  You might not enjoy reading novels, but you might find writing small scenes with characters to be a fantastic way to explore your understanding of psychology, to create what-if scenarios and... Maybe even learn how to transform jibberish about congruency and anchoring heuristics into something the layperson can read and enjoy.
NLP.
Neuroscience.
The human body, and disease.

If you can approach something as a neutral observer- not as a psychologist. Or any kind of ist or ism; then you can find a group you don&#039;t understand, or don&#039;t like and learn from them.  Even your enemies have insights, and valuable mental models to use... But only if you&#039;re capable of staying detached, discarding dogma, and not picking up your pitchfork.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, James.

You&#039;ve hit the hammer on the nail (no pun intended since Kaplan spoke a lot about the hammer).

The more our brain is exposed to specific events and results, the more patterns it forms. Hence, it becomes even more difficult for us to change habits as we age.

I&#039;m hoping to read more books outside my area of interest of human psychology, but novels bore me. Any suggestions?]]></description>
