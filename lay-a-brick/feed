					<description><![CDATA[Simple message but so true! It&#039;s really about what you become in the process.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear James,

Thank you for your awesome blog. The topic you wrote on this time is one I&#039;m struggling with from time to time. It&#039;s hard to keep that long-term perspective.

One of my favorite quotes to keep me on track is far more recent than the ones you presented. Not only does it shift the focus to the long term perspective, but it also grounds me regarding my short-term expectations. 

It&#039;s Bill Gates who said, &quot;Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.&quot;

Best regards from Germany,
Patrick]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a person with a passion for cultural differences and similarities, I&#039;d say: it&#039;s curious how those proverbs had travelled through &lt;i&gt;lingua latina&lt;/i&gt;. In Polish, there are phrases like: &quot;What&#039;s out of sight, is out of heart,&quot; &quot;Better late than never&quot; (the same^^!), &quot;The more the better&quot; and two versions of the last one: &quot;Rome/Krakow wasn&#039;t built in a moment.&quot; The changing name of the city moves this proverb so much closer &quot;to home&quot; - in any old European city, people were marking the buildings with the dates of their construction. Once you look closer, it becomes clear that only the very core of the city was built at the beginning. The rest was added up through the centuries - but it still wouldn&#039;t be there if not for the core. You only need to build the core until the others join in. Wow,]]></description>
