					<description><![CDATA[What if I want to get rid of a habit?

I translate for the wine industry and am too often involved in drinking events, have aperitifs and lately I taste at home - doing a sommelier course too - and before eating I got used to drink some wine. 
Like with some tasty things, also here sometimes it is not one but two glasses. 

I never get drunk, but 4 glasses of wine per day kill my healthy diet. Since &quot;only&quot; the waistline is suffering, I never really tried getting rid of this habit and now that I would like to get rid of this habit, since I would like to lose some weight, I realize I am stuck in it.

Is  there any article to help getting rid of habits?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve recently started a ritual of reading one piece of motivational, positive or inspirational writing on my laptop each morning. It&#039;s then much easier to carry on into my work - and in the right frame of mind too!

If only there was a James Clear email waiting for me each morning! - but then that would just make it TOO easy. ;)

Good to have you back James.]]></description>
