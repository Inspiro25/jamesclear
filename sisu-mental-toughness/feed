					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this article, being Finn myself it still amazes me how tough Finns were in the winter war. Our people were almost invisible, dressed in white while moving on skis in the winter forests. 

And this article made me understand that Sisu still carries on through generations. My mother is the toughest person I know, always keeping up hard work and pushing forward her ideas no matter how difficult things may get or what obstacles she comes across. And her Sisu is amazing.

I subscribed to your articles, looking forward to read more. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article in sisu.  Another layer of depth and meaning for your Christian readers:

I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Tonga, where in the local language &quot;Sisu&quot; means &quot;Jesus.&quot;  I re-read your piece, substituting the words.  Awesome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Nice post, thanks. According to Sisu, the Finns had/have yet one more state of mind. Most of us (I&#039;m a Finn, too) take situations to come as they are. I have talked to winter war veterans and they all said, they just fight back because there was no other alternative. Some of the soldiers had a strange quality to change to killers from every day man. For example, one man was extremely sharp submachine gunner... he was a taxi driver. Most of these veterans didn&#039;t talk much of this war, some of them went alcoholics.]]></description>
