He lists a number of ways positive thinking won&#039;t help in life, then gives a number of ways thinking negatively will help.

In one of the chapters, he talks about dwelling on the negative side of things, both to know that they aren&#039;t as bad as the worst case scenario might be, and to investigate ways the negative parts can be handled.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, this is a game-changer. Thanks so much for writing this and challenging our paradigms. At first, I was confused because of the popular mantra of focusing on what you want and that what you pay attention to grows. But, I took a leap of faith and tried the inversion technique on a current problem. 

My! I was totally horrified and repulsed by my worst case scenario and the fact that my current actions were on the inversion list. What a jolt of reality! But, the coolest part was the empowering process of eliminating those actions. And the memory of the worst case scenario itself was also an unexpected deterrent for future slips. Very effective! I am looking forward to applying this technique on other problems. Thanks James!]]></description>
