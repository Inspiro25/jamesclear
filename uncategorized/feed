										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is an excerpt from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, my New York Times bestselling book.</em></p>
<p>John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.</p>
<p>It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but—for some reason—Patterson&#8217;s shop still struggled to make money.</p>
<p>Eventually, he learned why: his employees were stealing from him.</p>
<p>In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.</p>
<p>As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.</p>
<p>Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months, Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.<a href="#footnote-1-31685" id="note-1-31685" rel="footnote">1</a></p>
<p>Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the National Cash Register Company. Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one thousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of the most successful businesses in America.</p>
<h2>The Best Way to Change a Habit</h2>
<p>The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the motivations of his employees, Patterson used technology to make the preferred behavior automatic.</p>
<p>There is an important lesson within this story that we can apply to all habits and behaviors. The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impossible to do. And the best way to create a good habit is to automate it so you never have to think about it again.</p>
<p>Typically, when people think about automating something, they imagine technology or a piece of software. And, certainly, this is a great way to automate a habit. You can save for retirement with an automatic deduction from your paycheck. You can curtail social media browsing with a website blocker.</p>
<p>Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.</p>
<p>But there are also many ways to &#8220;automate&#8221; your future decisions that don&#8217;t necessarily involve a piece of software.</p>
<h2>Onetime Actions That Lock In Good Habits</h2>
<p>One of the most practical ways to automate good habits is to look for onetime choices that require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time.</p>
<p>I’m fascinated by these single choices that can deliver returns again and again. Not long ago, I surveyed my readers on their favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term habits.<a href="#footnote-2-31685" id="note-2-31685" rel="footnote">2</a></p>
<p>Here are a few of the popular answers&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Remove your television from your bedroom.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Delete games and social media apps from your phone.</li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Permanently set your phone in Do Not Disturb mode.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness:</strong> Get a dog.</li>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> Buy better shoes to avoid back pain.</li>
<li><strong>Finance:</strong> Call your service providers (cable, electric, etc.) and ask for a lower rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These onetime actions only require effort once and make it easier to get better sleep, eat healthy, be productive, save money, and generally live better.</p>
<h2>The Upside of Automation</h2>
<p>The mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”</p>
<p>Today, technology and automation can handle an increasing number of daily tasks. Meal-delivery services can go grocery shopping for you. Healthcare services can automatically refill your prescriptions and ship them to you. IUDs can manage birth control on autopilot.</p>
<p>Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. When you automate as much of your life as you possibly can, you can spend your mental energy on the tasks machines cannot yet do.</p>
<p>Automation is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or yearly—like rebalancing your investment portfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from technology “remembering” to do them for you.</p>
<h2>The Downside of Automation</h2>
<p>Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well.</p>
<p>Binge watching becomes a habit because it takes more effort to stop looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.</p>
<p>Technology often creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media.</p>
<p>When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.</p>
<p>Personally, I often find myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write off these minor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug of “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing anything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The average person spends over two hours per day on social media.<a href="#footnote-3-31685" id="note-3-31685" rel="footnote">3</a> What could you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)</p>
<p>During the year I was writing <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, I experimented with a new time management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday morning when she would do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted.</p>
<p>Within the first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it became much easier to <a href="https://jamesclear.com/brain-food">eat the healthy stuff</a>.</p>
<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment.</p>
<p>By utilizing strategic onetime decisions and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for, but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Binanay started playing the violin when he was five. By age twelve, he performed at the world-famous Carnegie Hall in New York City and, soon after, at the White House.</p>
<p>In 2006, fresh off graduation from Villanova University, Binanay was positioned perfectly to build his life around music. He had just moved into his own place and started a job at a high-end violin shop.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when he noticed the bleeding.<br />
<span id="more-6042"></span></p>
<h2>Music and The Mind</h2>
<p>It was a gastrointestinal bleed. Binanay had experienced one before and he called his mom to let her know what was happening. She wanted to help, but David stopped her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. I&#8217;m going to handle it myself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This was the first time Binanay tried to handle a serious health issue on his own. When he arrived at the hospital, things began to spiral out of control. His hands started shaking and his mind began to separate from reality. &#8220;It was my first psychotic episode,&#8221; David recalls.</p>
<p>The situation went downhill fast. After resolving the bleeding issue and leaving the hospital, Binanay&#8217;s psychosis continued. He started having delusions and became fearful of everything. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t even walk into a grocery store because of the fear,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t really know what I was afraid of, but I feared for my life. In the span of one week I went from being normal to having a complete psychotic breakdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the peak of David&#8217;s psychosis, but his battle was just beginning. He would struggle with schizophrenia for the next five years. His medications worked, but David had trouble sticking to them. There was one thing, however, that always seemed to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad would look at me and say, &#8216;Dave, go get your violin.'&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Healing Power of Music</h2>
<p>Music stopped the pain. &#8220;Every time I played, I noticed a change,&#8221; David said. &#8220;I would channel my emotions through my music. The fear would turn to music. It would turn to sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new medication schedule helped too. David found it much easier to stick to his medication when he switched from pills to injections, which he only needed once per month.</p>
<p>Today, after a five-year battle, Binanay has made a full recovery. He plays his violin up to 10 hours per day and runs a non-profit, <a title="Music Over Mind" href="http://momoutreach.org/">Music Over Mind</a>, that performs free music shows at hospitals for people suffering from mental illness. &#8220;Music has been my catalyst for recovery,&#8221; Binanay says. &#8220;It has been a 180-degree turnaround. From complete loss to total re-birth. I recently got married. I have my own place with my wife. I feel like I&#8217;m a better person than before my illness.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Binanay&#8217;s story raises an interesting series of questions. What is music therapy? Can music help heal us? What role does music play in our health and happiness? Can music be a form of medicine?</p>
<p>Let me share what I&#8217;ve learned about the health benefits of music.</p>
<h2>The Stroke Victim Who Was Healed by Music Therapy</h2>
<p>In her book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/the-power-of-music">The Power of Music</a>, author Elena Mannes shares the story of a stroke patient who has lost the ability to speak. After struggling to re-learn normal speech patterns, the patient makes a breakthrough by singing her words rather than saying them. This approach is known as melodic intonation therapy and it engages the right side of the brain more than normal speech. As a result, this different section of the brain can stand in as a replacement for the normal language area and be used to communicate through song. <a href="#footnote-1-6042" id="note-1-6042" rel="footnote">1</a></p>
<p>At first glance, this story may seem like a very specific way to combine music and health, but it actually provides a good indication of the state of music therapy. There are many stories about music being used to help Parkinson&#8217;s patients move, autistic children focus and learn, or multiple sclerosis patients reduce spasms. These stories, however, have no research studies supporting them. My guess is that these are individualized results which, although true, are difficult to extrapolate to the entire population.</p>
<p>That said, there are a handful of health benefits of music that are well-accepted and scientifically proven.</p>
<h2>The Research: Music as Medicine</h2>
<p><strong>First, music can be used to relieve pain in patients.</strong> For example, surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic that listened to recorded music saw a 4x decrease in post-surgical pain. Music has also been shown to reduce the amount of anesthesia needed during operations. <a href="#footnote-2-6042" id="note-2-6042" rel="footnote">2</a><a href="#footnote-3-6042" id="note-3-6042" rel="footnote">3</a></p>
<p><strong>Second, music can be used to relieve stress and anxiety.</strong> Calming music decreases blood pressure, steadies the heart rate, and eases stress. Research has shown that music can reduce stress for patients undergoing surgeries and colonoscopies, for children undergoing medical procedures, and for patients with coronary heart disease. <a href="#footnote-4-6042" id="note-4-6042" rel="footnote">4</a><a href="#footnote-5-6042" id="note-5-6042" rel="footnote">5</a><a href="#footnote-6-6042" id="note-6-6042" rel="footnote">6</a><a href="#footnote-7-6042" id="note-7-6042" rel="footnote">7</a></p>
<p><strong>There is also preliminary evidence showing that listening to music can boost immune system function</strong> by decreasing stress hormones and increasing growth hormones. These changes should prime the body to be in a better state for recovering from and resisting illnesses, but the research is weak thus far and needs further investigation. <a href="#footnote-8-6042" id="note-8-6042" rel="footnote">8</a></p>
<p><strong>Finally, there are a range of studies that link music to happiness and pleasure in different ways.</strong> Despite the differences in the individual studies, the scientific consensus on the topic is that music does stimulate the same areas of the brain that trigger pleasure in other activities. A range of studies have found that listening to pleasurable music stimulates the mesocorticolimbic system in the brain, which is the same &#8220;pleasure center&#8221; that is triggered by humor, tasty food, and even cocaine. In this way, you could say that music is like a drug. If music makes you happy, then it might be possible that it is good for your health. <a href="#footnote-9-6042" id="note-9-6042" rel="footnote">9</a><a href="#footnote-10-6042" id="note-10-6042" rel="footnote">10</a><a href="#footnote-11-6042" id="note-11-6042" rel="footnote">11</a><a href="#footnote-12-6042" id="note-12-6042" rel="footnote">12</a></p>
<p>These benefits sound great, but is music unique in providing these benefits? Not really.</p>
<p>Given the current state of the research, it is not known if music is any better at healing than other alternatives. Music is not the only way to relieve pain or reduce stress. Music might work well for Person A while meditation is better for Person B and deep breathing or exercise help Person C. If nothing else, however, music is another tool at your disposal when you want to relieve pain, reduce stress, and promote healing.</p>
<h2>The Limitations of Music Therapy</h2>
<p>You can summarize the current state of research on the connection between music and health by saying that we know music impacts our brains and bodies, but we don&#8217;t quite understand exactly why or how music does this. And because we don&#8217;t understand the details, it can be hard to use music for healing.</p>
<p>To be honest, part of these issues could be solved if researchers performed better studies. Right now, researchers aren&#8217;t doing themselves any favors because musical research rarely follows a typical format.</p>
<p>Here are a few common errors (and solutions). <a href="#footnote-13-6042" id="note-13-6042" rel="footnote">13</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Current research doesn&#8217;t clearly differentiate if it is the act of playing music or the act of listening to music that benefits patients. For example, if a patient gets better after playing songs on a keyboard, chanting in different tones, or singing their favorite song, are they benefiting from the musical notes or from the act of playing music? Future studies should investigate if active performance or passive listening yields better results.</li>
<li>Current research poorly categorizes the impact of different music styles. Most researchers lump music therapy into broad &#8220;stimulating&#8221; or &#8220;relaxing&#8221; categories. Future research should include more clearly defined boundaries, so we can understand which types of music can be used to heal in specific situations.</li>
<li>Current research flip-flops on who controls the music. Sometimes the experimenter chooses the music. Sometimes the patient chooses their own music. This can complicate things because sometimes you are more likely to see music as having a positive impact simply if you selected the music. Future research should be more clear about this selection process.</li>
<li>Current research varies between individual listening, individual playing, and group playing. In many cases, patients may benefit from simply doing an activity with a group and not the music itself. Future research should investigate these environmental factors to help clarify the impact of individual vs. group music therapy.</li>
<li>Current research, at least what I found, was universally missing a large, randomized trial. This type of study is the gold-standard of research and if music therapy interventions are to be taken seriously, then a high quality randomized study is needed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Health Benefits of Music</h2>
<p>Whether it is a pick-me-up song that brightens your mood or a live-saving violin practice like that of David Binanay, we have all felt the healing power of music.</p>
<p>From a research standpoint, the health benefits of music are unproven. However, I have always said that I try to balance being a scientist with being a practitioner and, from a practical standpoint, there are very few reasons to avoid music as a way to improve your health and happiness. Music therapy is noninvasive, inexpensive, and convenient. And music is one of the lifestyle choices we can make that relieves stress and anxiety, decreases pain, and protects against disease.</p>
<p>Stefan Koelsch, a senior research fellow in neurocognition at the University of Sussex in Brighton, summarizes the healing effects of music by saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say music is a pill to abolish diseases. But &#8230; So many pills have horrible side effects, both physiological and psychological. Music has no side effects, or no harmful ones.&#8221; <a href="#footnote-14-6042" id="note-14-6042" rel="footnote">14</a><a href="#footnote-15-6042" id="note-15-6042" rel="footnote">15</a></p>

If you simply consumed music that you enjoyed all day long would you end up living a better life than if you had spent that time building a business you loved or mastering a skill that advanced your career? As with all uses of our time, there are tradeoffs to listening to music and it&#8217;s important to balance it with other areas of life that provide a payoff.</p></li><!--/#footnote-15.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes-->]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of my time thinking about ways that you can overcome illness and injury, boost your health and happiness, and live a more vibrant and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions I&#8217;ve come to is that <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">behavior change and habit formation</a> is one of the most powerful tools we have &#8230; and yet it is being largely ignored by medicine and healthcare.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about that problem and some simple ways to solve it.<br />
<span id="more-5134"></span></p>
<h2>Build Habits, Not Factories</h2>
<p>I think it&#8217;s strange that we know that behavior changes like <a href="https://jamesclear.com/eat-healthy">eating healthy</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/start-working-out">exercising more</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/cumulative-stress">reducing stress</a>, and <a href="https://jamesclear.com/creativity">boosting creativity</a> can improve your health (both in the short–term and long–term) and yet most doctors spend their time treating symptoms rather than teaching these behaviors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written previously about how forming healthy habits not only prevents illness, but can also act as a method for treating it. For example, using <a title="exercise and depression" href="https://jamesclear.com/exercise-and-depression">exercise as a treatment for depression</a>.</p>
<p>What if your doctor took this idea to heart and prescribed actions instead of medications?</p>
<p>Imagine how much time and energy doctors, pharmacists, and healthcare providers spend researching drugs, prescribing medications, and making sure that new drugs don&#8217;t conflict with the ones you&#8217;re currently taking. Compare that to how much time your doctor spends teaching you how to optimize your environment at home and at work to build healthy habits. (Has any doctor ever done this?)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that the medical system cares more about building pharmaceutical factories than building good habits.</p>
<p>What if, instead of dishing out pills to treat symptoms, healthcare professionals spent their time teaching patients how to act healthy? I&#8217;ve written about ways to do this. For example, <a title="change plate color" href="https://jamesclear.com/feeling-fat">changing the color of your plate</a> to make it easier to eat more vegetables or <a title="how to say no" href="https://jamesclear.com/how-to-say-no">using the phrase &#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8221;</a> to make sure that you resist temptation and actually stick to your health goals for the long–term.</p>
<p>These ideas are just two examples out of hundreds of simple tactics that can be used to make behavior change easier. These ideas come from the fields of behavioral psychology, consumer research, and elsewhere (and I&#8217;m doing my best to track down as many as possible).</p>
<h2>Teaching Actions Instead of Prescribing Pills</h2>
<p>There is a shocking amount of unnecessary treatment going on in healthcare.</p>
<p>As reported in <a title="medical mistakes" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/opinion/more-treatment-more-mistakes.html">this New York Times article</a>, orthopedic surgeons took an anonymous survey and admitted that 24% of the tests they ordered were medically unnecessary. That article also shared that the rate of doctor&#8217;s visits that lead to more than 5 medications being prescribed has more than tripled in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that doctors feel pressured to do &#8220;something&#8221; for patients and so they end up ordering drugs and procedures that won&#8217;t hurt them, but that don&#8217;t really help either. When I hear about stories like this, I feel like plucking my eyeballs out with a fork. Is this really the best we can do? Instead of wasting time and money on unnecessary procedures, why not spend that time teaching people how to implement lifestyle changes?</p>
<p>Regardless of the motivation behind these actions, the evidence is pretty clear. Our medical system is spending a lot of time and money treating symptoms and masking illnesses, and very little time teaching people how to change their behaviors and build better habits.</p>
<h2>Integrative Medicine: It Works, So Use It</h2>
<p>All of this is not to say that surgery or prescription drugs or medical treatment doesn&#8217;t work. Not only do those methods work, they save many lives. But it&#8217;s also true that in many cases, these treatments don&#8217;t work any better than behavior change. (Not to mention that behavior change is less expensive and more empowering over the long–term.)</p>
<p>And this is why I&#8217;m calling for more <strong>integrative medicine</strong> — a combination of the best of scientifically backed ideas from all fields. For many illnesses, research has already shown that behavior change leads to equivalent or better outcomes than medication. Imagine the long-term impact it could have (both by lowering costs and improving patient outcomes) if doctor&#8217;s spent time educating patients on how to create a healthier environment and stick to behavior changes?</p>
<p>As with most things in life, the right answer is probably a balance of both sides. For example, imagine prescribing a medication for the first 12 weeks (to provide short-term results) while also teaching the patient how to change their behavior, optimize their environment, and build healthier habits over that timespan (to provide long-term results).</p>
<p>It sounds logical, but right now I&#8217;m afraid that our system is spending far too much time and money on medications and treatments, while essentially ignoring the power of behavior change. Combining the two can lead to better outcomes and lower costs — everyone wins.</p>
<p>We have science and research that proves the efficacy of behavior change and we have a growing body of psychological tools that make these changes easier to achieve. And yet, the vast majority of doctors continue to spend their time telling people to take prescriptions instead of teaching people how to take action.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to set a higher standard in health and medicine by using integrative medicine to teach scientifically proven behavior changes rather than defaulting to a prescription because &#8220;we&#8217;re busy and it&#8217;s easier&#8221; or ordering another test to appease the patient.</p>
<p>Behavior change works, so why aren&#8217;t doctors teaching it to their patients?</p>
<p>P.S. If you want more practical ideas for how to build new habits (and break bad ones), check out my book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book/atomic-habits"><em>Atomic</em> <em>Habits</em></a>, which will show you how small changes in habits can lead to remarkable results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many benefits to running your own business.</p>
<p>You get to set the hours, you don&#8217;t have to ask for time off to take vacation, and in many cases, you can find more meaning and fulfillment in your work. But those aren&#8217;t the only reasons to become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Research is starting to reveal that, for a variety of reasons, entrepreneurs live longer, healthier lives than employees do.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about why that is and, most importantly, how it can help you live a healthier life whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or not.</p>
<p><span id="more-4351"></span></p>
<h2>The Link Between Entrepreneurship and Health</h2>
<p>It all started with a simple conversation.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the mid–morning sun at a Starbucks in central North Carolina (the backdrop for every great discovery of the 21st century). Ted Chandler, a physician for over 50 years and a former professor of medicine at Wake Forest University, was sharing a story with me about the connection between the number of small businesses in an area and the health of the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Given that we were both entrepreneurs who had a passion for health and wellness, we were interested in the link between entrepreneurship and health.</p>
<p>The article discussed researchers at Baylor University and Louisiana State University who discovered an interesting trend by combining data from the Center for Disease Control and the US Census. What they found was that as the number of small businesses increased, the health of the surrounding community improved.</p>
<p>For example, Summit County in Colorado (where there is an incredibly high number of small business) had a mortality rate, obesity rate, and diabetes rate that were each less than half of the national average.</p>
<p>The <a title="inc microbusinesses and health article" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201204/issie-lapowsky/small-business-does-a-body-good.html">original article</a> got my wheels turning, but didn&#8217;t provide many answers. For example, a large amount of small businesses could mean that the area is wealthy. And if that was the case, then was the improved health due to small business or because people could afford to live a healthy lifestyle?</p>
<p>With these thoughts kicking around my head, I set off to find some more robust research about the link between entrepreneurship and health.</p>
<h2>Research Reveals the Health Benefits of Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Eventually my search led me to <em>The Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology</em>, where I found <a title="entrepreneurs and employees health compared" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/096317909X472067/abstract">this study</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the health of a &#8220;nationally representative sample of employees and entrepreneurs&#8221; and examined a wide range of health factors for both groups. This included the rates of physical disease and mental illness, blood pressure, the number of sick days taken, the number of visits to the physician, and overall well–being and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>After the numbers were crunched, entrepreneurs were the clear winner in essentially every category. It was discovered that entrepreneurs showed significantly lower incidence of physical and mental illnesses, lower blood pressure, lower rates of hypertension, made fewer visits to the hospital, and enjoyed higher overall well–being and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now for the important questions:</p>
<p>What does all of this mean for you?</p>
<p>And how can you reap the health benefits of entrepreneurship, regardless of whether or not you own a business?</p>
<h2>Why Are Entrepreneurs Healthy?</h2>
<p>I’ve been an entrepreneur for over 2 years now. And even though my entrepreneurial career is still in it&#8217;s infancy, my experiences have mirrored much of the information above.</p>
<p>In general, the entrepreneurs that I have met are rarely overweight, often physically fit, and generally happier than people working for The Man.</p>
<p>But merely owning a business doesn&#8217;t make you healthy.</p>
<p>What I believe makes most entrepreneurs healthy isn&#8217;t the fact that they run a business, but that they approach life in a particular way. In other words, it&#8217;s their healthy mindset that often leads to a healthy life.</p>
<p>For example&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs give themselves permission to change the world and to pursue their dreams.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs believe in themselves and in the control they have over their own lives.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs trust that, even when things are uncertain, they’ll figure it out.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs wake up with a purpose that drives them. They have a vision of what they are working towards that pulls them out of bed each day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read through those qualities again.</p>
<p>Now imagine if you applied those same ideas to living healthy&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>You give yourself permission to change your health and pursue a healthy lifestyle.</li>
<li>You believe in yourself and in the control you have over your own health.</li>
<li>You trust that, even when you feel uncomfortable or stupid in the gym, you&#8217;ll figure it out.</li>
<li>You wake up with a purpose that drives you. You have a vision of why you want to be healthy that pulls you into the gym each day.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see how an entrepreneurial mindset can translate into a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>The feelings of empowerment and self–confidence that come from entrepreneurship find their way into virtually every area of your life. Convincing yourself to go to the gym seems pretty easy when you just spent all day convincing yourself that you could run a business.</p>
<h2>Anyone Can Live Like an Entrepreneur</h2>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think entrepreneurship is for everyone, but I also don’t think it needs to be.</p>
<p>I have plenty of friends who work &#8220;traditional&#8221; jobs and are just as happy and healthy as my entrepreneur friends. The key is that these people also tend to be confident and believe in themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working a regular job or blazing your own path, the important thing is to discover the empowering mindset that entrepreneurs so often display.</p>
<p>No job, entrepreneurial or otherwise, will singlehandedly save your health, but thinking like an entrepreneur can make it easier for you to live healthy and happy.</p>
