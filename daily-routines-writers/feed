					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading a lot of articles about writing habits and routines for the last four years or so and this is the one that has helped me most. Great idea to take the ideas of worthy writers and compile them to find out the consistent habits. I have adopted the 7-12 every morning approach and finding I have to compensate with a lot of exercise by necessity. Excellent post and thank you. You have done wonders for the quality of my output.

P.S. ^Regarding the Jericho Rivers idea, I can only say that I&#039;ve never heard of you, but if you are &quot;successful&quot; as you say and happy with your work then great, I envy you. But what you&#039;re saying is crap. Even the most spontaneous and enthusiastic writers like Ray Bradbury worked out a routine naturally. There are a few spontaneous novel writer&#039;s that have been worthy out there, but they are very, very much the minority. Your ideas might work for poetry and maybe for you if you really are &quot;successful&quot;, but your talk of &quot;fleshing&quot; and so on makes me think you&#039;re more concerned with looking successful and making money than integrity of fiction.

In the words of Jack London:- &#039;You can&#039;t wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I call a little BS on this (and all other articles like it). I&#039;ve had the good fortune to interview numerous working and successful writers (and like to think I am one, myself), and the only single UNIVERSAL trait that we ALL have in common is this: procrastination. Most writers will do ANYTHING other than write until it is absolutely necessary to squeeze those words out of the head. But this procrastination is not merely wasted time; no, it is the gathering of inspiration, information and the freeing of the mind to discover its path. Merely committing to putting words on paper during a period of time is not only pointless and stupid, but a complete and utter waste of time.

While I appreciate that the interviews above may have had honest appraisals of a period of time which worked for each author, only aspect that resonates with consistent truth is Henry Miller&#039;s point #9: &quot;Discard the Program when you feel like it.&quot; Let&#039;s face it: writing is a highly personal endeavor. Hack writing is especially well suited toward the styles suggested above, which themselves are merely responses to what the writers think the reporters want to hear after most likely getting the same inane request ad nauseum. 

Here are my habits to successful writing: Sit around a lot pondering my story. Look at the blank screen until my neck hurts. Make food. Walk around. Make more food. Water the garden. Shower or shit. Realize what was missing before. Sit back down and type until my fingers ache. Make sure I didn&#039;t contradict myself anywhere. Go out. Talk on the phone. Take some virtually illegible notes on scraps of paper and shove them in my pocket. Go home and put the notes on my desk, on top of everything else. Think about writing some more, but watch television instead. Get up the next day, dedicate it to research. Google things tangential to my topic, read until its boring and re-Google. Then go out with my kid, play, work on something completely unrelated. Write bad poetry. Watch television again. Skip a day or two. Sit down and re-read bits of my novel. Figure out what needs to be fleshed out. Research enough to ensure it isn&#039;t contradicting anything, fix what it does, look at my stack of notes and toss the ones that are no longer relevant. Write like crazy until my fingers hurt. Realize that I need another perspective and send it to my proofreader and editor for feedback, making sure they don&#039;t know anything about where it is going. Work on something completely unrelated while waiting on the feedback. When the feedback arrives in a day or two, polish the hell out of it and start the process over, preferably by skipping a day and playing with my kid.

In truth, some of my best work has been written by sitting on an idea for a year or so, without putting anything on paper until it has completely gelled. Then it gets dashed out in a mad fury without interruption. I&#039;m not alone in this. In fact, most people I know who try following the &quot;sit and write for X hours each day&quot; rule fail miserably to produce anything of value. Some do. Especially for non-fiction. But it is hardly good advice for most of us.]]></description>
