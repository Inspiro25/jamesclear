					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I was just wondering, what if I&#039;m not eating the right amount of calories in my feeding window? Like I&#039;m eating too little, is it better or worse, if I&#039;m trying to lose weight? Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I&#039;ve become quite fascinated with intermittent fasting. I&#039;m ready to take the challenge, adopt a lifestyle change and hopefully drop up to 20 lbs as body composition is my ultimate goal. 

My question, how many calories should I consume during my feeding window if fat loss and muscle gain are my goals?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

I do the 8:16 IF method.  I push my breakfast to Noon, train at around 5PM, eat a high protein, moderate essential fat, and moderate unprocessed carb diet.  I finish my eating window by around 8PM and I eat most of my carbs post workout.  My question is I like to have a Casein and water protein drink (120 calories) before I go to bed as it helps with my post workout recovery and DOMS.  Will this de-rail my fasting state overnight?  It is all protein and no carbs and protein does burn calories when it is digested.  Also, I have it around 11:30 - Midnight and my first meal is still 12 hours later.  The total fasting window is still 16 hours it is just the 120 calories before bed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it ok to eat a meal before you train or should I wait until my feeding window begins? I workout everyday primarily around 12 in the afternoon or so. I&#039;m on my 3rd day and I feel great I thought it would be harder but it&#039;s actually pretty easy if I drink enough water. I am natural and I&#039;m interested in getting into men&#039;s physique. Is this a proper nutrition plan for me?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Very interesting article and well explained. I have a question ... On a normal day I have a cup of coffee (2% milk + 2 tsps sugar)  in the morning; can easily go straight until about 4pm without anything else (perhaps a glass of water) when I have another cup of coffee. Sometimes I might nibble on a snack around the same time, and then its dinner around 7pm.  I feel I don&#039;t eat enough or a lot - but I need to tone up, drop my cholesterol levels and reduce the &#039;michelin tires&#039; around my abs. I would love to try the IF way, but don&#039;t know where to reduce the food intake. 

Any advise would be much appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there;

I am concerned about skipping breakfast as I frequently work out around 8 or 9. Usually I take a spin class and sometimes cap it off with some weights. Normally I might have some greek yogurt, toast and PB, cereal, or oatmeal before working out but a few weeks ago all I had was half a grapefruit and I had to cut class about 5-10 minutes early (very humiliating) because I was starting to faint. When I told a few family members/friends about it they got on my case about only having a grapefruit before working out. I dunno if they&#039;re right, but...

I&#039;m more concerned, though, about my energy levels. I usually die around 25 minutes in or so but manage to spring back at 35 minutes and am able to complete the class having given my best effort. If my last meal is at 8pm the night before, how can expect to kick butt? Are there any supplements that can help?

Thank you!]]></description>
