Yep. It&#039;s always better to be pulled into something than pushed away from it.]]></description>

Thanks Leon. I find it to be a useful phrase as well.

As always, I appreciate you taking time to read!]]></description>

Jennie -- thanks for sharing that manta of Chip Kelly. I find all sorts of crossover between sports and other areas of life. (I&#039;m sure being an athlete makes me a little biased in that regard.) Anyway, your comment is a great example of that overlap.

Win the day!]]></description>

I agree with you Leon! James, that&#039;s awesome! Sometimes I can get so wrapped up in something who&#039;s answer eludes me. I&#039;ll focus on it for so long, beating my head up against the wall, that I may just end up leaving it altogether. 

But you&#039;re right, if you allow yourself to shift focus and take on something exciting, enjoyable, unrelated, it can set the stage for reduced anxiety that&#039;ll allow for clearer thinking. And often freely provide the answer that you need.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The (now former) coach of the University of Oregon Ducks football team calls his philosophy &quot;win the day.&quot; Always focus on the present moment and the next play. If the last play was unsuccessful, shake it off by dealing only on the next play. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve tried to focus on incorporating into my life and I think you&#039;ve expressed the same concept here. One of the greatest things about it is that it opens you up to take risks because there is less to fear knowing that you won&#039;t wallow in the failure, should failure happen. And risks sometimes pay off in extraordinary ways. Win the day!]]></description>
