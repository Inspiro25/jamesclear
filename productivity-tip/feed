					<description><![CDATA[This is some insightful article, thanks!

However, for busy workers, knowing what is more important is not always as easy as it seems. When you have many tasks to achieve I think that it is mandatory to have a To-do. If you want to add priority management to it, in order to always know what it is more important for each day I recommend you to go for productivity apps like Beesy.

Then you have tasks that are not really important but urgent, and therefore becomes important. An Eisenhower metric for your todo (like in Beesy) can be of great help to keep on mind what to do and when to do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James,

Great post and a reminder for me to keep trying and actually doing the most important thing in the morning. But most days several tasks compete for &quot;most important&quot;.

How do you determine what is?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello James, 

I want to congratulate you on your work.  It&#039;s inspirational, thought provoking, stimulating, informational and best of all easy to read!  I&#039;ve been reading your articles regularly for a few months now and some I saved to refer to....this one in particular is a case in point.  Thank you for helping this 54 year old young  man to continue learning and growing!

My best wishes to you!

					<description><![CDATA[This is a wonderful piece.

I am the early-bird type and this article has just motivated me in setting my priorities around that time of the day when I am most energized mentally.

Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliantly simple tip James. Having said that, the simplest things can often be the most difficult to do.

The first thing I tend to do each day is some kind of marketing for roughly an hour. This is because I realised that getting and keeping customers is the most important thing a business owner should do.

This certainly isn&#039;t easy though, especially when I have clients breathing down my neck for results. But, if I didn&#039;t do the marketing I&#039;d have no clients.]]></description>
