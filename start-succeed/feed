					<description><![CDATA[I love that article. I guess it is the same as trusting the unknown, and things come when you are in that situation... starting and not knowing, and maybe not be perfect at it. But to start  is the sticking point I&#039;ve observed, I might use a few sentences of your article to tell my clients that for their life to change they need to start stepping into a new direction.

Love the excellence is not required for growth and it is more important to start than to succeed! :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, I liked your 2 minute rule to avoid procrastination.  It was an article that I discovered using the Buffer app.  I liked the article.  So, I followed the hyper link to this article.  I am newer to twitter, am in the process of transforming my health, and my husband is starting to do his photography business!  We just got back from Hawaii, and like to travel.  I look forward to your free newsletter.  I can see it will give me ongoing great content.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article about getting started.  I just have so much that I have let go for so long, I just don&#039;t know where to start.  I guess that&#039;s where the Eisenhower box comes in.  Any other pointers ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, thank you for this article - I just discovered your writing via LinkedIn and am looking forward to following along. Anyway, this article reminded me of an Ira Glass quote that I love and wanted to share here:

“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wrote on another post of yours that I liked. I don´t agree with this one, though. I sailed boats professionally for 5 years, I studied a lot, practice a lot, and focus a lot (more than anything else in my life) and I never made the top 10 in my local village. There is something more than starting to be good (not even great) that I missed at least for boat sailing.]]></description>
