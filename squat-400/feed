					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate this article very much, especially point #3. I see my physical therapist for the last time tomorrow, and your point helps me stand firm. She only has 6 weeks with me, so was pushing to accomplish what should, for me, have taken 6 months. I was painfully injured at the second session due to hurrying &quot;progress&quot;. After that, I insisted on slower, knowing my body, and not wanting any further setbacks. She didn&#039;t understand, and kept pushing. 

So your info really helps confirm to me the importance of safety, even while working to be consistent. Great article.

Oh, and I&#039;m 63, female, and in a wheelchair. Yet the &quot;principles&quot; you share are applicable even to me. You have wisdom beyond your years, thanks for sharing your experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Mr. James!!!

This is my first time to comment on you. :) 

I&#039;m following your writing since last 4-5 months or so. In this span many times I had thought in my mind to write a comment on your newsletter (most of them are very very impressive) but I couldn&#039;t.

This time again you wrote it nicely as always and make me write these few words for you. I know you must be too busy and not having time to read my message, but still today I want to wish you congrats for 400 Squatting and best luck for 500 and so on... and not only for this achievement but for your wonderful writing.

Again, thank you so much for your inspirational writing... keep it up!

Thank you,
Jitendra Kulkarni

					<description><![CDATA[James, I am 62 years of age and on most days I carry out one exercise regime or the other. Your above article will add some new elements of knowledge and motivation to it.

Thanks a lot.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks, great article. I go to the gym regularly. I do a lot of abs, tri, bi. I know I need some military press. I do a little. 

The muscles I work really hard are the legs&#039; ones. I would like to do 2 plates, 180lbs, scared I like. Where you say go real lite, I like that and I will try. Also I have many logs which I don&#039;t use, so I will start to &#039;keep a record&#039;.
 
Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/squat-400#comment-12816&quot;&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;.

James is right. Unless you&#039;ve got some kind of injury or are taking statin drugs, you should be able to do it. I&#039;ve been squatting for about 5 months, and progressing even slower than James. But I&#039;ve lost weight - actually almost the same weight but lost fat and gained muscle and am close to squatting 300 pounds.

The only reason I&#039;m not further along is I hate DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). If I&#039;m not careful to stretch, apply heat, and eat right, I&#039;m sore and lifting is really, really unappealing. If I&#039;m feeling fine, I love it and am ready to go.]]></description>

Multiple readers seem surprised James squats without catch bars.  But he uses bumper plates, which are fine to drop.  

How to miss a rep:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGb36ZoVuBY#t=150  

(Yes, that&#039;s super-hot Rita at Cal Strength.  You&#039;re welcome.)]]></description>
