					<description><![CDATA[So, I&#039;m trying to eat less and move more to better manage my weight. I have a weight-loss goal but I&#039;m really trying to put into practice the idea that the habit matters more than the end result. I&#039;m tracking my calories each day and yesterday I way overshot my calorie limit, by 200+. If I were solely focused on the goal of weight loss, I would have considered that a pretty big failure and it would have been really discouraging. But, this time, I&#039;m focused on building the habit of tracking calories. Because yesterday was the 19th day in a row that I&#039;ve completed my tracking diary, I actually consider it a successful day, and I&#039;m motivated to keep going.

Just wanted to give that example to say that focusing on the habit and not the goal really makes all the difference in the world!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Hope this message finds you in good health.

Read your article and realised the importance of the minute things in life. Thanks to you for a such a short and simple article to understand the developing of a habit. Have incorporated it already.

Any tips on dropping a unwanted habit?

Cheers,
Akshay]]></description>
