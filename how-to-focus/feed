					<description><![CDATA[James -- Thank You. This one, yet SIMPLE, article explained more to me about my own &quot;Sovereign Authority and POWER&quot; than ALL the volumes of esoteric knowledge that I have read and studied over the last 30 years of my life.

Again, Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, so true... so much information out there for us, this can be very confusing. Which way to go? Which path will give me the results I desire?

Thanks James, all that you give is simple and wholesome, at this very moment I see clearly... laid to rest a blockage. 

WOW, once again... Thanks James :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;You have the ability to focus, you just need to choose what to direct it towards instead of acting like the lion and dividing your attention among the four legs of the chair.&quot;

This is exactly what I needed to hear/read to remind me to stay focused in pursuit of my goals, dreams and passions...

Truly wise, my friend. and I love your blog! Keep up the great work. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James - I loved this article.  

Eliminating distraction is a current hobby of mine :)  At times it feels like I&#039;m rewiring my brain, convincing myself that I don&#039;t need to grab at every shining object (idea, website, project, tool) that catches my attention.

I&#039;m getting better everyday, and my next challenge is to purposefully decide how to spend my now free time.  Some how, I&#039;ve forgotten that I&#039;m in command.  Now to grab the wheel, steer the ship and stay the course!

Thanks for the encouragement!

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Really enjoyed the article but the comment section is getting even more fascinating!

There are so many different approaches to take/discuss:

-Focusing on fundamentals vs Finding the optimal path
-Experimenting vs Researching
-Common knowledge/Best practices vs Challenging status quo
-Single focus vs Multi-focus

And indeed when done right each and every approach can work magnificently, depending on the situation. 

For example, I am more than happy to just go out and run when my goal is to run a marathon, but I am also sure that doing research and best practices was the right thing to do when designing a book.

No wonder that chair was so effective on lions, we don&#039;t even need a chair, just some thoughts, to get ourselves confused :))

Cheers]]></description>
