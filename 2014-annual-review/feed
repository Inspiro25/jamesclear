					<description><![CDATA[Hey James,

That&#039;s an awesome year in review...  I reconnected with your blog just before Xmas 2014.  

And I have gotten so much from just a handful of posts I&#039;ve read so far...  My year last year was the worst I&#039;ve ever had  for many reasons...  So I&#039;ve used a lot of what you&#039;ve written about to refocus my self for 2015.

Keep up the good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your annual review James. I am happy to say that I am one of your new subscribers as of this year, and enjoy your articles very much. It is refreshing to read well thought and well researched articles that are not accompanied by a sales pitch. Each article gives me something to think about, and something to act on. I&#039;m also in the process of completing an annual review and goal setting, so it is also good to know that even for the &quot;experts&quot; there are sticking points and challenges.

Thanks for the inspiration, and I look forward to future articles, as well as your book in 2015.

Best regards,
Joanna]]></description>
