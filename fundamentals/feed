					<description><![CDATA[James,

Nice article on the fundamentals. However, with over 40 years of working out in both the military and civilian life, I believe your gym example is lacking. First a question; have you ever worked out on a BOSU? If you have, you should agree that it is a great piece of kit for balance and stability, working a myriad of core muscle groups. For individual to be standing on a BOSU doing lateral raises, he working much more than a tiny group of muscles. He is getting a great leg, ab and upper body workout. In that sense, I would say he is definitely working on the fundamentals!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey James, read the post and I thought it was useful.

As a product designer (for printers), I  have to live &quot;avoiding edge cases&quot; daily. 

Do I add an icon on the back of the printer to support external feeding so that the minority know it exists, but that the majority would find meaningless (and even find the design less beautiful)?

I would rather design to satisfy the majority target user consistently even if it means that minority users don&#039;t get what they want.

In my personal life, I practice carb cycling. I used to agnonise over when to cheat, what GI my foods should be, how much carbs/protein to eat etc etc.

But it&#039;s just not sustainable after a few starts, I&#039;ve just stuck to (Clean Mon to Fri, Easy Sat and Sun).  It&#039;s been &#062;1 year now and the effort has &#039;disappeared&#039;.

The question I often ask myself is &#039;Will this work AND is it easy enough for me to do while not thinking about it?&#039; If yes, it&#039;s at a high enough level.

Keep up the writing!

					<description><![CDATA[James, Thank you so much for this post. I have been trying hard to do the same since last few days and realised we actually get productive only by learning and practising the fundamentals. Thanks for hitting the bull&#039;s eye and a beautiful way of presenting the stuff. Really stuck a chord with me. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read this post yesterday and it stuck with me. So much so, I found my point-of-view altered, at work. This is helpful. 

Several times a week, I walk 3 or 4 miles, often listening to audiobooks. Today was no exception; for the last several weeks, I&#039;ve been listening to Tolle&#039;s &quot;The Power of Now.&quot; I&#039;m not sure that you or your readers would agree with this, but I&#039;ve been thinking that Tolle&#039;s book is in the vein of this posting of yours. It seems that we should be working on the fundamentals of living in the present.

What are the thoughts of you and your readers?

I look forward to your email on M &#038; Th&#039;s. Thank you.

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post, James. I can say this: most people spend much time on details instead of concentrating on fundaments, especially when it comes to starting a diet, or a business, because they are:
1. inexperienced
and (therefore)
2. fearful 

In my opinion, focusing on details is just a pure procrastination to delay the execution, to delay getting out of the comfort zone. Sometimes it is lack of strategy, I agree, but more often than not it is a lack of confidence, experience and knowledge.]]></description>
