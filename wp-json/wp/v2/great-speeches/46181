This speech was originally given as a commencement address at the University of Western Australia in 2013. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-speech-transcript\">Speech Transcript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In darker days I did a corporate gig at a conference for this big company who made and sold accounting software in a bid, I presumed, to inspire their salespeople to greater heights. They\u2019d forked out 12 grand for an inspirational speaker who was this extreme sports guy who had had a couple of his limbs frozen off when he got stuck on a ledge on some mountain. It was weird. Software salespeople I think need to hear from someone who has had a long successful career in software sales not from an overly optimistic ex-mountaineer. Some poor guy who had arrived in the morning hoping to learn about sales techniques ended up going home worried about the blood flow to his extremities. It\u2019s not inspirational, it\u2019s confusing. And if the mountain was meant to be a symbol of life\u2019s challenges and the loss of limbs a metaphor for sacrifice, the software guy\u2019s not going to get it, is he? Because he didn\u2019t do an Arts degree, did he? He should have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arts degrees are awesome and they help you find meaning where there is none. And let me assure you\u2026 there is none. Don\u2019t go looking for it. Searching for meaning is like searching for a rhymes scheme in a cookbook. You won\u2019t find it and it will bugger up your souffl\u00e9. If you didn\u2019t like that metaphor you won\u2019t like the rest of it. Point being I\u2019m not an inspirational speaker. I\u2019ve\u00a0never ever lost a limb on a mountainside metaphorically or otherwise and I\u2019m certainly not going to give\u00a0career advice because, well I\u2019ve never really had what most would consider a job. However I have had large groups of people listening to what I say for quite a few years now and it\u2019s given me an inflated sense of self importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will now, at the ripe old age of 37.9, bestow upon you nine life lessons&#8211; to echo of course the nine lessons of carols of the traditional Christmas service, which is also pretty obscure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might find some of this stuff inspiring. You will definitely find some of it boring and you will definitely forget all of it within a week. And be warned there will be lots of hokey similes and obscure aphorisms which start well but end up making no sense. So listen up or you\u2019ll get lost like a blind man clapping in a pharmacy trying to echo-locate the contact lens fluid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for my old poetry teacher. Here we go, ready?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One:<\/strong> You don\u2019t have to have a dream. Americans on talent shows always talk about their dreams. Fine if you have something you\u2019ve always wanted to do, dreamed of, like in your heart, go for it. After all it\u2019s something to do with your time, chasing a dream. And if it\u2019s a big enough one it\u2019ll take you most of your life to achieve so by the time you get to it and are staring into the abyss of the meaningless of your achievement you\u2019ll be almost dead so it won\u2019t matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never really had one of these dreams and so I advocate passionate, dedication to the pursuit of short-term goals. Be micro-ambitious. Put your head down and work with pride on whatever is in front of you. You never know where you might end up. Just be aware the next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your periphery, which is why you should be careful of long-term dreams. If you focus too far in front of you you won\u2019t see the shiny thing out the corner of your eye. Right? Good! Advice metaphor\u2026 look at me go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Two:<\/strong> Don\u2019t seek happiness. Happiness is like an orgasm. If you think about it too much it goes away. Keep busy and aim to make someone else happy and you might find you get some as a side effect. We didn\u2019t evolve to be constantly content. Contented Homo Erectus got eaten before passing on their genes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Three:<\/strong> Remember it\u2019s all luck. You are lucky to be here. You are incalculably lucky to be born and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family who encouraged you to go to uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family that\u2019s unlucky and you have my sympathy but you are still lucky. Lucky that you happen to be made of the sort of DNA that went on to make the sort of brain which when placed in a horrible child environment would make decisions that meant you ended up eventually graduated uni. Well done you for dragging yourself up by your shoelaces. But you were lucky. You didn\u2019t create the bit of you that dragged you up. They\u2019re not even your shoelaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I worked hard to achieve whatever dubious achievements I\u2019ve achieved but I didn\u2019t make the bit of me that works hard any more than I made the bit of me that ate too many burgers instead of attending lectures when I was here at UWA. Understanding that you can\u2019t truly take credit for your successes nor truly blame others for their failures will humble you and make you more compassionate. Empathy is intuitive. It is also something you can work on intellectually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Four:<\/strong> Exercise. I\u2019m sorry you pasty, pale, smoking philosophy grads arching your eyebrows into a Cartesian curve as you watch the human movement mob winding their way through the miniature traffic cones of their existence. You are wrong and they are right. Well you\u2019re half right. You think therefore you are but also you jog therefore you sleep therefore you\u2019re not overwhelmed by existential angst. You can\u2019t be can\u2019t and you don\u2019t want to be. Play a sport. Do yoga, pump iron, and run, whatever but take care of your body, you\u2019re going to need it. Most of you mob are going to live to nearly 100 and even the poorest of you will achieve a level of wealth that most humans throughout history could not have dreamed of. And this long, luxurious life ahead of you is going to make you depressed. But don\u2019t despair. There is correlation between depression and exercise. Do it! Run, my beautiful intellectuals run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Five: <\/strong>Be hard on your opinions. A famous bon mot asserts, opinions are like assholes in that everyone has one. There is great wisdom in this but I would add that opinions differ significantly from assholes in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined. I used to do exams in here\u2026 It\u2019s revenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must think critically and not just about the ideas of others. Be hard on your beliefs. Take them out onto the verandah and hit them with a cricket bat. Be intellectually rigorous. Identify your biases, your prejudices, your privileges. Most of society is kept alive by a failure to acknowledge nuance. We tend to generate false dichotomies and then try to argue one point using two entirely different sets of assumptions. Like two tennis players trying to win a match by hitting beautifully executed shots from either end of separate tennis courts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, while I have science and arts graduates in front of me please don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences are at odds with one another. That is a recent, stupid and damaging idea. You don\u2019t have to be unscientific to make beautiful art, to write beautiful things. If you need proof \u2013 Twain, Douglas Adams, Vonnegut, McEwan, Sagan and Shakespeare, Dickens for a start. You don\u2019t need to be superstitious to be a poet. You don\u2019t need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You don\u2019t have to claim a soul to promote compassion. Science is not a body of knowledge nor a belief system it\u2019s just a term which describes human kinds\u2019 incremental acquisition of understanding through observation. Science is awesome! The arts and sciences need to work together to improve how knowledge is communicated. The idea that many Australians including our new PM and my distant cousin Nick Minchin believe that the science of anthropogenic global warming is controversial is a powerful indicator of the extent of our failure to communicate. The fact that 30 percent of the people just bristled is further evidence still. The fact that that bristling is more to do with politics than science is even more despairing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Six: <\/strong>Be a teacher! Please! Please! Please be a teacher. Teachers are the most\u00a0admirable and important people in the world. You don\u2019t have to do it forever but if you\u2019re in doubt about what to do be an amazing teacher. Just for your 20s be a teacher. Be a primary school teacher. Especially if you\u2019re a bloke. We need male primary school teachers. Even if you\u2019re not a teacher, be a teacher. Share your ideas. Don\u2019t take for granted your education. Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seven: <\/strong>Define yourself by what you love. I found myself doing this thing a bit recently where if someone asks me what sort of music I like I say, \u201cWell I don\u2019t listen to the radio because pop song lyrics annoy me,\u201d or if someone asks me what food I like I say, \u201cI think truffle oil is overused and slightly obnoxious.\u201d And I see it all the time online \u2013 people whose idea of being part of a subculture is to hate Coldplay or football or feminists or the Liberal Party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a tendency to define ourselves in opposition to stuff. As a comedian I make my living out of it. But try to also express your passion for things you love. Be demonstrative and generous in your praise of those you admire. Send thank you cards and give standing ovations. Be pro stuff not just anti stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eight:<\/strong> Respect people with less power than you. I have in the past made important decisions about people I work with \u2013 agents and producers \u2013 big decisions based largely on how they treat the wait staff in the restaurants we\u2019re having the meeting in. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the most powerful cat in the room, I will judge you on how you treat the least powerful. So there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nine: <\/strong>Finally, don\u2019t rush. You don\u2019t need to know what you\u2019re going to do with the rest of your life. I\u2019m not saying sit around smoking cones all day but also don\u2019t panic! Most people I know who were sure of their career path at 20 are having mid-life crises now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said at the beginning of this ramble, which is already three-and-a-half minutes long, life is meaningless. It was not a flippant assertion. I think it\u2019s absurd the idea of seeking meaning in the set of circumstances that happens to exist after 13.8 billion years worth of unguided events. Leave it to humans to think the universe has a purpose for them. However I\u2019m no nihilist. I\u2019m not even a cynic. I am actually rather romantic and here\u2019s my idea of romance: you will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and god it\u2019s tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad and then you\u2019ll be old and then you\u2019ll be dead. There is only one sensible thing to do with this empty existence and that is fill it. Not fillet. Fill it. And in my opinion, until I change it, life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can. Taking pride in whatever you\u2019re doing. Having compassion, sharing ideas, running, being enthusiastic and then there\u2019s love and travel and wine and sex and art and kids and giving and mountain climbing, but you know all that stuff already. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting thing this one meaningless life of yours. Good luck and thank you for indulging me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Background Tim Minchin is a comedian, actor, writer, musician, poet, composer, and songwriter.
