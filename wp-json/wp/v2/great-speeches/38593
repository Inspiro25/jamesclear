Sometimes, as you know, they\u2019ll tell you even if you haven\u2019t asked. Sometimes, even when you\u2019ve specifically requested they <em>not<\/em> tell you, they\u2019ll tell you.<\/p>\n<p>So: What do I regret? Being poor from time to time? Not really. Working terrible jobs, like \u201cknuckle-puller in a slaughterhouse?\u201d (And don\u2019t even ASK what that entails.) No. I don\u2019t regret that. Skinny-dipping in a river in Sumatra, a little buzzed, and looking up and seeing like 300 monkeys sitting on a pipeline, pooping down into the river, the river in which I was swimming, with my mouth open, naked? And getting deathly ill afterwards, and staying sick for the next seven months? Not so much. Do I regret the occasional humiliation? Like once, playing hockey in front of a big crowd, including this girl I really liked, I somehow managed, while falling and emitting this weird whooping noise, to score on my own goalie, while also sending my stick flying into the crowd, nearly hitting that girl? No. I don\u2019t even regret that.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s something I do regret:<\/p>\n<p>In seventh grade, this new kid joined our class. In the interest of confidentiality, her Convocation Speech name will be \u201cELLEN.\u201d ELLEN was small, shy. She wore these blue cat\u2019s-eye glasses that, at the time, only old ladies wore. When nervous, which was pretty much always, she had a habit of taking a strand of hair into her mouth and chewing on it.<\/p>\n<p>So she came to our school and our neighborhood, and was mostly ignored, occasionally teased (\u201cYour hair taste good?\u201d \u2014 that sort of thing). I could see this hurt her. I still remember the way she\u2019d look after such an insult: eyes cast down, a little gut-kicked, as if, having just been reminded of her place in things, she was trying, as much as possible, to disappear. After awhile she\u2019d drift away, hair-strand still in her mouth. At home, I imagined, after school, her mother would say, you know: \u201cHow was your day, sweetie?\u201d and she\u2019d say, \u201cOh, fine.\u201d And her mother would say, \u201cMaking any friends?\u201d and she\u2019d go, \u201cSure, lots.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes I\u2019d see her hanging around alone in her front yard, as if afraid to leave it.<\/p>\n<p>And then \u2014 they moved. That was it. No tragedy, no big final hazing.<\/p>\n<p>One day she was there, next day she wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>End of story.<\/p>\n<p>Now, why do I regret <em>that<\/em>? Why, forty-two years later, am I still thinking about it? Relative to most of the other kids, I was actually pretty <em>nice<\/em> to her. I never said an unkind word to her. In fact, I sometimes even (mildly) defended her.<\/p>\n<p>But still. It bothers me.<\/p>\n<p>So here\u2019s something I know to be true, although it\u2019s a little corny, and I don\u2019t quite know what to do with it:<\/p>\n<p>What I regret most in my life are <em>failures of kindness<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering, and I responded . . . sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.<\/p>\n<p>Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in <em>your<\/em> life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth?<\/p>\n<p>Those who were kindest to you, I bet.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I\u2019d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: <em>Try to be kinder<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the million-dollar question: What\u2019s our problem? Why aren\u2019t we kinder?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I think:<\/p>\n<p>Each of us is born with a series of built-in confusions that are probably somehow Darwinian. These are: (1) we\u2019re central to the universe (that is, our personal story is the main and most interesting story, the <em>only<\/em> story, really); (2) we\u2019re separate from the universe (there\u2019s US and then, out there, all that other junk \u2013 dogs and swing-sets, and the State of Nebraska and low-hanging clouds and, you know, other people), and (3) we\u2019re permanent (death is real, o.k., sure \u2013 for you, but not for me).<\/p>\n<p>Now, we don\u2019t <em>really<\/em> believe these things \u2013 intellectually we know better \u2013 but we believe them viscerally, and live by them, and they cause us to prioritize our own needs over the needs of others, even though what we really want, in our hearts, is to be less selfish, more aware of what\u2019s actually happening in the present moment, more open, and more loving.<\/p>\n<p>So, the second million-dollar question: How might we DO this? How might we become more loving, more open, less selfish, more present, less delusional, etc., etc?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes, good question.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I only have three minutes left.<\/p>\n<p>So let me just say this. There <em>are<\/em> ways. You already know that because, in your life, there have been High Kindness periods and Low Kindness periods, and you know what inclined you toward the former and away from the latter. Education is good; immersing ourselves in a work of art: good; prayer is good; meditation\u2019s good; a frank talk with a dear friend; establishing ourselves in some kind of spiritual tradition \u2014 recognizing that there have been countless really smart people before us who have asked these same questions and left behind answers for us.<\/p>\n<p>Because kindness, it turns out, is <em>hard<\/em> \u2014 it starts out all rainbows and puppy dogs, and expands to include . . . well, <em>everything<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>One thing in our favor: some of this \u201cbecoming kinder\u201d happens naturally, with age. It might be a simple matter of attrition: as we get older, we come to see how useless it is to be selfish \u2014 how illogical, really. We come to love other people and are thereby counter-instructed in our own centrality. We get our butts kicked by real life, and people come to our defense, and help us, and we learn that we\u2019re not separate, and don\u2019t want to be. We see people near and dear to us dropping away, and are gradually convinced that maybe we too will drop away (someday, a long time from now). Most people, as they age, become less selfish and more loving. I think this is true. The great Syracuse poet, Hayden Carruth, said, in a poem written near the end of his life, that he was \u201cmostly Love, now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And so, a prediction, and my heartfelt wish for you: as you get older, your self will diminish and you will grow in love. YOU will gradually be replaced by LOVE. If you have kids, that will be a huge moment in your process of self-diminishment. You really won\u2019t care what happens to YOU, as long as they benefit. That\u2019s one reason your parents are so proud and happy today. One of their fondest dreams has come true: you have accomplished something difficult and tangible that has enlarged you as a person and will make your life better, from here on in, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations, by the way.<\/p>\n<p>When young, we\u2019re anxious \u2014 understandably \u2014 to find out if we\u2019ve got what it takes. Can we succeed? Can we build a viable life for ourselves? But you \u2014 in particular you, of this generation \u2014 may have noticed a certain cyclical quality to ambition. You do well in high-school, in hopes of getting into a good college, so you can do well in the good college, in the hopes of getting a good job, so you can do well in the good job so you can . . .<\/p>\n<p>And this is actually O.K. If we\u2019re going to become kinder, that process has to include taking ourselves seriously \u2014 as doers, as accomplishers, as dreamers. We <em>have<\/em> to do that, to be our best selves.<\/p>\n<p>Still, accomplishment is unreliable. \u201cSucceeding,\u201d whatever that might mean to you, is hard, and the need to do so constantly renews itself (success is like a mountain that keeps growing ahead of you as you hike it), and there\u2019s the very real danger that \u201csucceeding\u201d will take up your whole life, while the big questions go untended.<\/p>\n<p>So, quick, end-of-speech advice: Since, according to me, your life is going to be a gradual process of becoming kinder and more loving: Hurry up. Speed it along. Start right now. There\u2019s a confusion in each of us, a sickness, really: <em>selfishness<\/em>. But there\u2019s also a cure. So be a good and proactive and even somewhat desperate patient on your own behalf \u2014 seek out the most efficacious anti-selfishness medicines, energetically, for the rest of your life.<\/p>\n<p>Do all the other things, the ambitious things \u2014 travel, get rich, get famous, innovate, lead, fall in love, make and lose fortunes, swim naked in wild jungle rivers (after first having it tested for monkey poop) \u2013 but as you do, to the extent that you can, <em>err in the direction of kindness<\/em>. Do those things that incline you toward the big questions, and avoid the things that would reduce you and make you trivial. That luminous part of you that exists beyond personality \u2014 your soul, if you will \u2014 is as bright and shining as any that has ever been. Bright as Shakespeare\u2019s, bright as Gandhi\u2019s, bright as Mother Teresa\u2019s. Clear away everything that keeps you separate from this secret luminous place. Believe it exists, come to know it better, nurture it, share its fruits tirelessly.<\/p>\n<p>And someday, in 80 years, when you\u2019re 100, and I\u2019m 134, and we\u2019re both so kind and loving we\u2019re nearly unbearable, drop me a line, let me know how your life has been. I hope you will say: It has been so wonderful.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-38593\" class=\"footnote\"><p>The transcript was originally published on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theladders.com\/career-advice\/george-saunders-to-syracuses-class-of-2013-accomplishment-is-unreliable\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">Ladders<\/a> as part of their showcase of commencement addresses that stand the test of time.<\/p><\/li><!--\/#footnote-1.footnote--><\/ol><\/div><!--\/#footnotes-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Background George Saunders is an American writer and winner of the Man Booker Prize for Fiction for his novel\u00a0Lincoln in the Bardo.\u00a0Saunders delivered this speech about &#8220;failures of kindness&#8221; as the commencement address to Syracuse University&#8217;s class of 2013.
