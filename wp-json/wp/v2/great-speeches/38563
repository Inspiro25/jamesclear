I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially \u201cDays of our Lives.\u201d My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we\u2019d join the caravan. We\u2019d hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather\u2019s car, and off we\u2019d go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips. On one particular trip, I was about 10 years old. I was rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car. My grandfather was driving. And my grandmother had the passenger seat. She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell.<\/p>\n<p>At that age, I\u2019d take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic. I\u2019d calculate our gas mileage &#8212; figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending. I\u2019d been hearing an ad campaign about smoking. I can\u2019t remember the details, but basically the ad said, every puff of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life: I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was satisfied that I\u2019d come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, \u201cAt two minutes per puff, you\u2019ve taken nine years off your life!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I have a vivid memory of what happened, and it was not what I expected. I expected to be applauded for my cleverness and arithmetic skills. \u201cJeff, you\u2019re so smart. You had to have made some tricky estimates, figure out the number of minutes in a year and do some division.\u201d That\u2019s not what happened. Instead, my grandmother burst into tears. I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opened my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly intelligent, quiet man. He had never said a harsh word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother. I had no experience in this realm with my grandparents and no way to gauge what the consequences might be. We stopped beside the trailer. My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, \u201cJeff, one day you\u2019ll understand that it\u2019s harder to be kind than clever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What I want to talk to you about today is the difference between gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy &#8212; they\u2019re given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you\u2019re not careful, and if you do, it\u2019ll probably be to the detriment of your choices.<\/p>\n<p>This is a group with many gifts. I\u2019m sure one of your gifts is the gift of a smart and capable brain. I\u2019m confident that\u2019s the case because admission is competitive and if there weren\u2019t some signs that you\u2019re clever, the dean of admission wouldn\u2019t have let you in.<\/p>\n<p>Your smarts will come in handy because you will travel in a land of marvels. We humans &#8212; plodding as we are &#8212; will astonish ourselves. We\u2019ll invent ways to generate clean energy and a lot of it. Atom by atom, we\u2019ll assemble tiny machines that will enter cell walls and make repairs. This month comes the extraordinary but also inevitable news that we\u2019ve synthesized life. In the coming years, we\u2019ll not only synthesize it, but we\u2019ll engineer it to specifications. I believe you\u2019ll even see us understand the human brain. Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Galileo, Newton &#8212; all the curious from the ages would have wanted to be alive most of all right now. As a civilization, we will have so many gifts, just as you as individuals have so many individual gifts as you sit before me.<\/p>\n<p>How will you use these gifts? And will you take pride in your gifts or pride in your choices?<\/p>\n<p>I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I\u2019d never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles &#8212; something that simply couldn\u2019t exist in the physical world &#8212; was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I\u2019d been married for a year. I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn\u2019t work since most startups don\u2019t, and I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen after that. MacKenzie (also a Princeton grad and sitting here in the second row) told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I\u2019d been a garage inventor. I\u2019d invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn\u2019t work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings. I\u2019d always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.<\/p>\n<p>I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people, and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, \u201cThat sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn\u2019t already have a good job.\u201d That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all. After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I\u2019m proud of that choice.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow, in a very real sense, your life &#8212; the life you author from scratch on your own &#8212; begins.<\/p>\n<p>How will you use your gifts? What choices will you make?<\/p>\n<p>Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions?<\/p>\n<p>Will you follow dogma, or will you be original?<\/p>\n<p>Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?<\/p>\n<p>Will you wilt under criticism, or will you follow your convictions?<\/p>\n<p>Will you bluff it out when you\u2019re wrong, or will you apologize?<\/p>\n<p>Will you guard your heart against rejection, or will you act when you fall in love?<\/p>\n<p>Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit swashbuckling?<\/p>\n<p>When it\u2019s tough, will you give up, or will you be relentless?<\/p>\n<p>Will you be a cynic, or will you be a builder?<\/p>\n<p>Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?<\/p>\n<p>I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story. Thank you and good luck!<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-38563\" class=\"footnote\"><p>This speech was published on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princeton.edu\/news\/2010\/05\/30\/2010-baccalaureate-remarks\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">Princeton website<\/a>.<\/p><\/li><!--\/#footnote-1.footnote--><\/ol><\/div><!--\/#footnotes-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Background This speech was originally delivered as the baccalaureate&nbsp;remarks to graduates from Princeton University on May 30, 2010.
