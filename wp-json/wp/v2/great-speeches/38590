So I\u2019ll start out with that. But if you guys get bored or something and say \u2018Well I thought we were supposed to have fun listening to this today.\u2019 You can raise your hand and say \u2018Could you talk about leadership or team building or business strategy or ethics or something else?\u2019 I gave a talk recently at Google, in fact I\u2019ve given three talks at Google. And the first talk I gave they said \u2018What are you going to talk about?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, what do you want to talk about?\u2019 They said, \u2018About whatever you want. What do you usually talk about?\u2019 Well I usually talk about leadership, culture, team building, strategy, ethics. And they said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to hear about that team building crap. We get that all the time. We want to hear about self-improvement.\u2019 So I will mix in with our multidisciplinary topic a little bit of self-improvement as well. Is that OK? OK.<\/p>\n<p>So why is it important to be a multidisciplinary thinker? The answer comes from the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein who said, \u2018To understand is to know what to do.\u2019 Could there be anything that sounds simpler than that? And yet it\u2019s a genius line, to understand is to know what to do. How many mistakes do you make when you understand something? You don\u2019t make any mistakes. Where do mistakes come from? They come from blind spots, a lack of understanding. Why do you need to be multidisciplinary in your thinking? Because as the Japanese proverb says, \u2018The frog in the well knows nothing of the mighty ocean.\u2019 You may know everything there is to know about your specialty, your silo, your \u201cwell,\u201d but how are you going to make any good decisions in life \u2013 the complex systems of life, the dynamic system of life \u2013 if all you know is one well?<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to learn what Munger calls, \u2018the big ideas\u2019 from all the different disciplines. Right up front I want to tell you what my trick was, because if you try to do it the way he did it, you don\u2019t have enough time in your life to do it. It\u2019s impossible. Because the fields are too big and the books are too thick. So my trick to learn the big ideas of science, biology, etc., was I found this science magazine called Discover Magazine. Show of hands, anybody here ever heard of Discover magazine? A few people. OK. And I found that this magazine every month had a really good interview with somebody from some aspect of science. Every month. And it was six or seven pages long. It was all in layperson\u2019s terms. The person who was trying to get their ideas across would do so using good stories, clear language, and they would never fail to get all their big ideas into the interview. I mean if you\u2019re given the chance to be interviewed by Discover Magazine and your field is nanoparticles or something, aren\u2019t you going to try your very best to get all the good ideas into the interview with the best stories. OK. So I discovered that on the Internet there were 12 years of Discover Magazine articles available in the archives. So I printed out 12 years times 12 months of these interviews. I had 144 of these interviews. And I put them in these big three ring binders. Filled up three big binders. And for the next six months I went to the coffee shop for an hour or two every morning and I read these. And I read them index fund style, which means I read them all. I didn\u2019t pick and choose. This is the universe and I\u2019m going to own the whole universe. I read every single one. Now I will tell you that out of 144 articles, if I\u2019d have been selecting my reading material, I probably would have read about 14 of them. And the other 130? I would never in a million years read six pages on nanoparticles. Guess what I had at the end of six months? I had inside my head every single big idea from every single domain of science and biology. It only took me 6 months. And it wasn\u2019t that hard because it was written in layperson\u2019s terms. And really, what did I really get? Just like an index fund, I captured all the parabolic ideas that no one else has. And why doesn\u2019t anybody else have these ideas? Because who in the world would read an interview on nanoparticles? And yet that\u2019s where I got my best ideas. I would read some arcane subject and, oh my god, I saw, \u2018That\u2019s exactly how this works over here in biology.\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s exactly how this works over here in human nature.\u2019 You have to know all these big ideas. Or there is an alternative, find somebody who did what I did and just get all the ideas from them. Now when I was your age and I was in school I thought the asymmetry of it was very unfair because I had to do all the work. So every time I go back and meet with a group of students I change the asymmetry around. I did all the work for you\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I have (multiple examples) of models that I derived from what I call my \u2018three buckets\u2019. Let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got my three buckets in here. I do. I do have my three buckets. OK. So this is how I use ideas that no one else in the world uses and yet I can be comfortable that they\u2019re right. A statistician\u2019s best friend is what? A large, relevant sample size. And why? Because a principle derived from a large relevant sample size can\u2019t be wrong can it? The only way it could be wrong is if the sample size is too small or the sample itself is not relevant. So I want to tell you what my three buckets are where I derive my models, my multidisciplinary models. Number one is 13.7 billion years. Is that a large sample? It\u2019s the largest one in the whole universe. There is no larger sample. Because what is it? It\u2019s the inorganic universe. Physics. Geology. Anything that\u2019s not living goes in my bucket number 1. 13.7 billion years.<\/p>\n<p>Bucket number 2 is 3.5 billion years. It\u2019s biology on the planet Earth. Is that a big sample size? Is it relevant? We\u2019re biological creatures. Let me ask you this, inorganic, bucket number one, is it relevant? We live in it. So bucket number one we live in, 13.7 billion years. Bucket number two is what we\u2019re part of, biology. 3.5 billion years. And number three is 20,000 years of recorded human history. That\u2019s the most relevant of all. That\u2019s our story. That\u2019s who we are.<\/p>\n<p>So we\u2019re going to take a couple of examples here of multidisciplinary thinking. We\u2019ll ask this question, is there a simple two word description that accurately describes how everything in the world works? That would be very useful wouldn\u2019t it if you know how everything works in just two words? So we go to bucket number one. How does everything work? We go to Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion. We\u2019re getting very multidisciplinary here. Does anybody in the room know what Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion says? (Answer: \u201cFor every action there will always be an equal and opposite reaction.\u201d) That\u2019s beautiful. He wins one of my pens here for answering that question correctly. I always give out rewards. It\u2019s like operant conditioning from psychology, right? So there you go.<\/p>\n<p>Yes if I put this bottle of water on this table, Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion says that if the bottle pushes down on the table with \u2018force x\u2019, and it also strangely says that the table pushes back with equal \u2018force x\u2019. That\u2019s very strange. But you know how long that\u2019s been true? 13.7 billion years that\u2019s been true. Now what if I push down twice as hard, what does the table do? Well if I push down twenty one and a half times as hard? What does the table do? Twenty one and a half! OK. Now is there a good word, a catchall word to describe what we\u2019re talking about here when this pushes down and this thing pushes back? Yeah, it\u2019s reciprocation isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s not mere reciprocation. It\u2019s perfectly mirrored reciprocation. The harder I push, the harder it pushes back. Does everybody buy that? That\u2019s bucket number one. That\u2019s how the world works. It\u2019s mirrored reciprocation. Everything in the inorganic universe works that way.<\/p>\n<p>We go to bucket number 2. I\u2019m going to introduce a little humor into this. Even though this is a dog, pretend it\u2019s a cat. OK? This is a cat for the time being. Mark Twain said that a man who picks up a cat by its tail will learn a lesson he can learn in no other way. What is this cat going to try to do? It\u2019s going to do what? (Answer: \u201cAttack you.\u201d) Yeah it\u2019s going to try and scratch me with its sharp claws. And why? It doesn\u2019t find being picked up by its tail very agreeable does it? Now what if I start swinging this cat around by its tail. What does the cat do now? Now it\u2019s trying to scratch my eyes out. It said, \u2018You escalated on me pal, I\u2019m going to escalate back on you.\u2019 Does that sound a lot like mirrored reciprocation? But what if instead of doing something disagreeable with this cat we do something very agreeable with this cat? And this cat\u2019s sitting here and we come over and we gently pick it up by its tummy and we put it in the crook of our elbow and we gently stroke it. Does the cat try and scratch us? What does it do? It licks our hands. And as long as I sit here and stroke it, it\u2019s going to continue to try and lick my hand. It wants to show me what? \u2018I like this. This is agreeable. You\u2019re a good guy. Keep it up man!\u2019 It is mirrored reciprocation isn\u2019t it? If I act in a disagreeable way to the cat, the cat acts in a disagreeable way back, and mirrored. If I act in an agreeable way, what do you think we\u2019re going to find when we go to bucket number three? It\u2019s exactly the same thing isn\u2019t it? Your entire life. Every interaction you have with another human being is merely mirrored reciprocation. Now you\u2019re going to say to yourself \u2018This is too simple. It can\u2019t be this simple.\u2019 It is this simple! It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not sophisticated. This is a very sophisticated model we just derived isn\u2019t it? We did it in a multidisciplinary fashion didn\u2019t we? We looked into the three largest sample sizes that exist, the three most relevant, and they all said exactly the same thing. Do you think we can bank on that? 100 percent we can bank on that.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you think about things being complex as being sophisticated like most people do, you think the more complex it is, the more sophisticated it is. I want you to remember, as best you can, what I\u2019m about to say. It\u2019s very, very important. Albert Einstein once listed what he said were the five ascending levels of cognitive prowess. Now there\u2019s nobody in this room that doesn\u2019t want to be level number one. Right? That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. You don\u2019t want to be level number five. You want to be level number one. Wait until you hear what these levels are, it\u2019s going to blow your mind. So number 5 he said, at the very bottom, was smart. OK. That\u2019s the lowest level of cognitive prowess is being smart. The next level up, level 4, is intelligent. Level 3, next up, is brilliant. Next level up, level 2, he said is genius. What? What\u2019s higher than genius? He must have that backward. No he doesn\u2019t. Wait until you hear what number one is according to Albert Einstein. We just demonstrated it. Number one is simple. Simple transcends genius.<\/p>\n<p>Why is simple, the right kind of simple, better than genius? Because you can understand it! I bought this book \u2013 I usually take it when I\u2019m giving a talk like this. It\u2019s The Ethics by Spinoza. Spinoza\u2019s ethics book was written by a true genius. And guess what? You can\u2019t understand anything in it. But can you understand what I walked you through \u2013 mirrored reciprocation? OK.<\/p>\n<p>Now, because this is an economics club, right, everybody here is interested in economics? So let\u2019s give an example of a model derived, multidisciplinary, same way we did before, but is just about as pure an economic model as you can find. So now we\u2019re going to ask the question, what\u2019s the most powerful force that we as human beings, both as individuals and groups, can potentially harness towards achieving our ends in life?<\/p>\n<p>OK. We go to bucket number one. We ask, what\u2019s the most powerful force in bucket number one? I\u2019m going to quote Albert Einstein again. He said, \u2018The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\u2019 But that\u2019s not all he said about compound interest. He not only said that it\u2019s the most powerful force in the universe, he said it\u2019s the greatest mathematical discovery of all time. He said it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world. And he said that those who understand it get paid by it and those who don\u2019t pay for it. He said all these things, Albert Einstein, about compound interest. Now what\u2019s a good working definition of compound interest? I will propose one. You can have your own, but this is mine. I say compound interest is dogged incremental constant progress over a very long time frame. Is that a fair definition? Alright? I think that\u2019s the answer from bucket number 1. The most powerful force that could be potentially harnessed is dogged incremental constant progress over a very long time frame.<\/p>\n<p>We go to bucket number 2. 3.5 billion years of biology. What\u2019s the most powerful force in three and a half billion years of biology? It\u2019s the machine of evolution. How does it work? Dogged incremental constant progress over a long time frame. This is the beauty of deriving things multidisciplinary. You can\u2019t be wrong! You see these things lined up there like three bars on a slot machine. Boy do you hit the jackpot.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think we\u2019re going to find when we go to bucket number three? 20,000 years of human experience on earth. You want to win a gold medal in the Olympics. You want to learn a musical instrument. You want to learn a foreign language. You want to build Berkshire Hathaway. What\u2019s the formula? Dogged incremental constant progress over a very long time frame. Look how simple this is. This is above genius. It\u2019s absolutely above genius because you can understand it. This isn\u2019t somebody drawing all these formulas and things up here about, you know, how numbers multiply and amplify over time. The problem that human beings have is we don\u2019t like to be constant. Think of each one of those terms. Dogged incremental constant progress over a very long time frame. Nobody wants to be constant. We\u2019re the functional equivalent of Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the mountain. You push it up half way, and you go, \u2018Aw, I\u2019ll come back and do this another time.\u2019 It goes back down. \u2018I\u2019ve got this great idea, I\u2019m going to really work hard on it.\u2019 You push it up half way and,\u2019 Aw, you know I\u2019ll get back to this next month.\u2019 This is the human condition. In geometric terms this is called variance drain. Whenever you interrupt the constant increase above a certain level of threshold you lose compounding, you\u2019re no longer on the log curve. You fall back onto a linear curve or God forbid a step curve down. You have to be constant. How many people do you know that are constant in what they do? I know a couple. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Everybody wants to be rich like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. I\u2019m telling you how they got rich. They were constant. They were not intermittent.<\/p>\n<p>Let me give you an example of why intermittency is perhaps the most important thing in your lives whether you realize it or not. We\u2019ll begin with the example of bringing home a puppy from the pet shop. Brand spanking new puppy from the pet shop. And the kids are so excited, they\u2019re so excited. What\u2019s your goal of bringing home this puppy to your household? I say it\u2019s to have an engaged, contributing, all-in, new member of your household. And night number one, how are we doing? It\u2019s a disaster. This thing\u2019s over in the corner shaking like a leaf. It\u2019s anything but engaged. It\u2019s anything but contributing and it\u2019s anything but all-in. It\u2019s shaking like a leaf. Human beings are really good at solving this problem. We know we need to create a calm, reassuring, secure, and safe environment.<\/p>\n<p>We know that even though this puppy can\u2019t understand what we\u2019re saying, we need to communicate in soothing tones. And we also know that we need to provide food and water for this puppy. But underlying all these things, stitching them all together, we really know we have to be constant, don\u2019t we? You can\u2019t not feed the puppy one day, or what happens? Well, the puppy freaks out. The puppy becomes a neurotic puppy. It doesn\u2019t know whether it can trust you or not. This trust that this puppy needs to go all-in is dependent upon you being constant in these behaviors. Does everybody accept that? So, if we are constant, usually in about seven days more or less, if we are constant, this little puppy will trot over to our side and it will attach itself to us. And for the rest of its life it will be willing to die for us. That puppy just went all-in, didn\u2019t it? Now did it go all-in because it\u2019s our idea that we want an engaged, contributing, all-in new member of our household? It doesn\u2019t even know what our idea is, does it? Why did it just go all in? It was the puppy\u2019s idea!<\/p>\n<p>Now let me tie this to your lives. I did this at Google and they really couldn\u2019t figure out what I was doing. And then afterwards they said \u2018You know that was really good. Your eight dollar crystal ball that\u2019s really a good trick. So I\u2019ll do my eight dollar crystal ball trick. And I told them\u2026I had rows bigger than this one, full of the smartest people in the world. And I said guess what I\u2019m going to do with my eight dollar crystal ball? I said, I\u2019m going to do a psychic reading of anybody in this room. Anybody. And I said to Google, \u2018If you think that I\u2019ve got a stooge in the room where I\u2019ve got this prearranged, I don\u2019t. Go out in the corridor and bring somebody in. I\u2019ll do the psychic reading.\u2019 This eight dollars I spent on Amazon is the best money I ever spent. So I\u2019m going to select you. What\u2019s your name? (Answer: \u201cEmily\u201d) We\u2019re going to take Emily, we\u2019re going to do a psychic reading of Emily right in front of you. You\u2019re not going to believe this. I\u2019m going to nail this. You\u2019re all going \u2018This guy\u2019s a nutcase.\u2019 Spencer\u2019s going, \u2018Man why did I invite this guy?\u2019 Just be patient, Spencer, this is good stuff. I\u2019ll pull it off. So I\u2019m going to tell Emily what she\u2019s been looking for her whole life. Is there anybody here who thinks I can do this? Well, wait until you hear my answer and then for the rest of your life you\u2019re all going to go, \u2018I know what everybody in the world is looking for.\u2019 Emily, your entire life you\u2019ve been on a quest, an odyssey, a search for that individual that you can 100 percent absolutely and completely trust. But who\u2019s not just trustworthy, but principled, and courageous, and competent, and kind, and loyal, and understanding, and forgiving, and unselfish. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? (Answer: \u201cDead on\u201d) You know what else my eight dollar crystal ball tells me? If you ever think you may have encountered this person, you are going to probe and probe and test and test to make sure that they are real, that you\u2019re not being fooled. And the paradox is that it looks like you\u2019re probing for weakness but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re probing for strength. And the worst day of your life is if instead of strength, you get back weakness. And now you feel betrayed. You know why? You\u2019ve got to start your search all over again. It\u2019s the worst thing in the whole world isn\u2019t it? Does everybody here agree with me on this? Look how simple this is.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s your 22-second course in leadership. That\u2019s all it takes. You don\u2019t have to go to business school. You don\u2019t need books. You don\u2019t need guest speakers. All you have to do is take that list that\u2019s in Emily\u2019s head, and every single other person in this room, every single other person in the whole world, has this list in their head \u2013 trustworthy, principled, courageous, competent, loyal, kind, understanding, forgiving, unselfish, and in every single one of your interactions with others, be the list! Remember how that puppy went all in? You do this with the other human beings you encounter in life. They\u2019re all going all-in and not because it\u2019s your idea. Most people spend all day long trying to get other people to like them. They do it wrong. You do this list, you won\u2019t be able to keep the people away. Everybody\u2019s going to want to attach to you. And be willing to do what? Just like the puppy, they\u2019d be willing to die for you. Because you are what they\u2019ve been looking for their whole lives. This is pretty profound, isn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n<p>Look at this picture. I love this picture. Does this woman look like she\u2019s having a good time? OK. So I helped teach this high school class in Los Angeles, and the first class of each semester, a brand new group just like you guys, and I make them go through the following exercise. And believe me just like my eight dollar crystal ball, afterwards you\u2019re going to go \u2018I\u2019m really glad I heard that. Because now I really understand things at a level I didn\u2019t understand them before.\u2019 And to understand is to what? To know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>This will clear up all your blind spots about yourself and other human beings. I asked the group, show of hands, how many of you think all human beings are alike? Why? (Answer: &#8216;We all have the same basic needs. We express them differently. Tremendous diversity in how we go about meeting them, but ultimately we all have the same needs.&#8217;) You get two pens! That\u2019s a beautiful answer. So we\u2019re going to identify what those needs are. What\u2019s your name? (Answer: &#8216;Craig&#8217;) Craig nailed it. Show of hands. How many of you want to be paid attention to? I mean is there really anybody here who doesn\u2019t want to be paid attention to? You\u2019re a different kind of human being if you are. OK. How many of you want to be listened to? How many of you want to be respected? How many of you want meaning, satisfaction, and fulfillment in your life in the sense that you matter? And then I tell the high school kids, number five. I put it number five. Even though it\u2019s the most important of the five, I put it last, because if I put it first, you wouldn\u2019t raise your hands because it\u2019s awkward. They\u2019re just going to think I\u2019m weird. But then they do raise their hand because I soften them up. How many of you want to be loved? Everybody\u2019s exactly the same. The only difference is, as Craig said, the strategy that they\u2019re employing to try to get to fulfill those needs. OK.<\/p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m going to tell you the strategy that dogs use. The dog is going to be very unhappy with me for telling you this. I\u2019m ratting them out. So when your dog is in the backyard and he goes to the fence between your house and the next house and he talks to the dog next door, I\u2019m going to tell you what he says. No one has ever divulged this before. You\u2019re the first group to hear this. Your dog says to the dog next door, \u2018Can you believe how easy it is to manipulate human beings and get them to do whatever you want them to do for you?\u2019 And the dog next door goes, \u2018I know it\u2019s a piece of cake.\u2019 And your dog says \u2018Yeah. All you have to do is every single time they come home, you greet them at the door with the biggest unconditional show of attention that they\u2019ve ever gotten in their whole life. And you only have to do it for like 15 seconds, and then you can go back to doing whatever you were doing before and completely ignore them for the rest of the evening.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>However, you do have to do this every single time they come home. And what will the person do? They\u2019ll take care of them. They\u2019ll do anything for this dog. OK? Now do you think that this woman feels she\u2019s being paid attention to? And listened to? And respected? Do you think she\u2019s getting meaning, satisfaction, and fulfillment? Do you think she matters to this dog? And do you think she thinks this dog loves her? And what does the dog get in return? Everything.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do, if you want everything in life from everybody else, is first pay attention, listen to them, show them respect, give them meaning, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Convey to them that they matter to you. And show you love them. But you have to go first. And what are you going to get back. Mirrored reciprocation. Right? See how we tie this all together? The world is so damn simple. It\u2019s not complicated at all! Every single person on this planet is looking for the same thing. Now why is it that we don\u2019t act on these very simple things?<\/p>\n<p>So I have an example I use with the class, my elevator example. I\u2019m famous for my elevator story. You\u2019re standing in front of an elevator. The doors open. And inside the elevator is one solitary stranger. You\u2019ve never met this person before in your whole life. You walk into the elevator; you have three choices for how you\u2019re going to behave as you walk into this elevator. Choice number one: you can smile and say good morning. And I say, at least in California, if you do that, 98 percent of the time the person will smile, say good morning back. You can test it. OK. My guess is you\u2019re going to find that 98 percent of the time that people say good morning. Choice number two: you can walk in and you can scowl and hiss at this stranger in the elevator. And they have no idea why you\u2019re scowling and hissing at them. And I say 98 percent of the time, they may not hiss back at you, but they will scowl back at you. And option number three. This is where the wisdom comes. You can walk into the elevator and you can do nothing. And what do you get 98 percent of the time if you walk into an elevator and you do nothing from that stranger in the elevator? Nothing. It\u2019s mirrored reciprocation isn\u2019t it? But what did you have to do? You have to go first. And you\u2019re going to get back whatever you put out there.<\/p>\n<p>This is why these bars are full of people at 2 a.m. drowning their sorrows. Knocking down these drinks. \u2018When\u2019s the world going to give me something man? When am I going to get mine?\u2019 Well, what did you ever do? Did you ever get up in the morning and smile at the world? No. You either did nothing or you scowled and hissed at the world. You\u2019re getting back exactly what you would expect to get back if you understood how the world really works. Which is why we study multidisciplinary things right? We can\u2019t be wrong on this. can we? It\u2019s all mirrored reciprocation. So what do you want to do? You want to go positive, you want to go first. What\u2019s the obstacle? There\u2019s a big obstacle. This is an economics club. Certainly, you have all heard of Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize winner in economics. Behavioral economics. And what did he win his Nobel Prize for? For answering the question, why would people not go positive and not go first when there\u2019s a 98 percent chance you\u2019re going to benefit from it, and only a 2 percent chance the person\u2019s going to tell you to \u2018screw off\u2019 and you\u2019re going to feel horrible, lose face, and all the rest of that. And that\u2019s real. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t do it. He said there\u2019s huge asymmetry between the standard human desire for gain and the standard human desire to avoid loss. Which one do you think is more powerful? 98 percent versus 2!<\/p>\n<p>Now I gave this same talk at Fairfax up in Toronto, Prem Watsa\u2019s outfit. It\u2019s the Berkshire Hathaway of Canada. And I said \u2018Of all people in the whole world, you guys should not be making this mistake.\u2019 Why? Because you\u2019re in the insurance business. How does insurance work? You\u2019re supposed to spend 2 percent to protect 98 percent, right? Look what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re spending 98 percent to protect against the 2 percent probability that somebody makes you look foolish. Lou Brock set the Major League record for stolen bases with the St. Louis Cardinals many years ago. And he once said, \u2018Show me a man who is afraid of appearing foolish and I\u2019ll show you a man who can be beat every time.\u2019 And if you\u2019re getting beat in life, chances are it\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid of appearing foolish. So what do I do with my life? I risk the two percent. I was so proud the other day, I was reading Bono on Bono. Bono\u2019s the lead singer of U2. He\u2019s the only other person I\u2019ve ever encountered in my entire life, and I asked all my cronies, \u2018Has anybody else ever encountered this elevator model before?\u2019 \u2018No. No that\u2019s yours Peter.\u2019 And I said, \u2018You know how I said 98-2? Guess who\u2019s got the exact same model? Bono! Well he doesn\u2019t have 98-2, he\u2019s got 90-10.\u2019 Those are his numbers \u2013 90-10. Can I be wrong on this? That guy is really squared away. I hope some day I\u2019m as squared away as he is. It\u2019s incredible to think, he figured it out. That\u2019s why that guy\u2019s had such a great life. He goes, \u2018You know, I know 10 percent of people are going to screw me. That\u2019s OK. If I\u2019m not willing to be vulnerable and expose myself to that 10%, I\u2019m going to miss the other 90%.\u2019 Does that make sense? Now Charlie Munger one day, you know he turned my whole life upside down. I was over at his house one day and he said, \u2018Peter, I\u2019ve been hearing about you going around giving all these talks. You don\u2019t have to go around the country telling people how to make more money.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well that\u2019s not what I do Charlie.\u2019 I was very nimble on my feet. I said there\u2019s a catch. I do tell how to make more money but, by the way, if you do these things that get people all-in and whatnot, you\u2019ll make all the money there is to be made. You really will. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here to give you the second half of the message, which is how to be a good person! What\u2019s your name? (Answer: &#8216;Albert&#8217;). Albert, how many lifetimes do you have Albert? (Answer: &#8216;One&#8217;). That\u2019s correct, you get a pen. You see Albert lucked out, he got an easy question. Is your lifetime important to you Albert? (Answer: &#8216;One of the most important. Absolutely&#8217;).<\/p>\n<p>Now what do we know in economics, it\u2019s an economics model, what do we know we need to use as our decision making prism whenever something is both finite, like one, and important like your life? How do we have to make decisions? You had Mankiw here right? He didn\u2019t talk about opportunity cost? Have you all heard of opportunity cost? It\u2019s the classic illustration of opportunity cost. You have a finite number of something, it\u2019s important. If you\u2019re doing \u2018A\u2019 with it, it means what? It means you\u2019re not doing B or C or D or E. What do you have to do? You have to evaluate all the different alternatives and pick the one that\u2019s most optimal. Is that fair? So you\u2019ve got one lifetime. How do you want to spend your one lifetime? Do you want to spend your one lifetime like most people do, fighting with everybody around them? No. I just told you how to avoid that. And in exchange have what? A celebratory life. Instead of an antagonistic fighting life. All you have to do is go positive, go first, be patient enough. You know we have to be patient for a week with this puppy. Do you know how long it usually takes for a human being to do all the probing and testing that Emily was going to do and to find out that you\u2019re for real? It takes six months. This is why nobody does it. \u2018Oh it takes too long.\u2019 Compared to what? Look at the plan B that everybody uses. It\u2019s terrible! It doesn\u2019t work. They spend their whole lives fighting with everybody.<\/p>\n<p>The three hallmarks of a great investment are superior returns, low risk, and long duration. The whole world concentrates on Category 1. But if you\u2019re a leader of any merit at all, you should be treating these three as what? Co-priorities. How do you get low risk and long duration? Win-Win. This is the biggest blind spot in business. People are actually proud of a win-lose relationship. \u2018Yeah we really beat the crap out of our suppliers.\u2019 You know, \u2018We\u2019ve got these employees for\u2026you know, we\u2019ve got them on an HB1 visa, they can\u2019t work anywhere else for three years.\u2019 They\u2019re proud of it! Total Win-Lose. You take game theory and you insert the word lose in any scenario in game theory and what do you have? A suboptimal outcome. What happens when you insert win-win in any game theory scenario, what do you get? Optimal every time. What must you necessarily do if you\u2019re interested in achieving win-win frameworks with your important counterparties in life? You must understand the basic axiom of clinical psychology, which I know because I\u2019m multidisciplinary. I also learned psychology. The basic axiom of clinical psychology reads, \u2018If you could see the world the way I see it, you\u2019d understand why I behave the way I do.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty good isn\u2019t it? Now there\u2019s two corollaries to that axiom. And I say if you buy the axiom, which you should, you must buy the two corollaries as well because they\u2019re logical extensions. They\u2019re undeniable. Corollary number one, if that axiom is true and you want to understand the way someone\u2019s behaving, you must see the world as they see it. But corollary number two, if you want to change a human being\u2019s behavior and you accept that axiom, you must necessarily, to get them to change, change how they see the world. Now this sounds impossible. It\u2019s not really that hard. You take a business. Most employees of a business see the world as employees. What if you could get them to see the world instead through the eyes of an owner? Do you think that\u2019s going to change how they behave? It totally changes how they behave. Employees don\u2019t care about waste. Owners do. Employees don\u2019t self-police our place. Owners do.<\/p>\n<p>This is the secret to leadership. The secret to leadership is to see through the eyes of all six important counterparty groups and make sure that everything you do is structured in such a way to be win-win with them. So here are the six. Your customers, your suppliers, your employees, your owners, your regulators, and the communities you operate in. And if you can truly see through the eyes of all six of these counterparty groups and understand their needs, their aspirations, their insecurities, their time horizons \u2013 how many blind spots do you have now? Zero. How many mistakes are you going to make? You\u2019re going to make zero. People don\u2019t think this is possible. It\u2019s really easy. To understand is to know what to do. So I\u2019m going to wrap up here because I\u2019ve only got two minutes. There\u2019s this great African proverb. It\u2019s the definition of win-win. \u2018If you want to go quickly, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.\u2019 Live your life to go far together. Don\u2019t live it to go quickly alone. Most people grow up wanting to go quickly alone. It doesn\u2019t work. You wind up like Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. You get to the end of your life. Yeah you\u2019re rich, you\u2019re powerful, you\u2019re famous, and you want a do-over because you realize at the end of your life, \u2018I didn\u2019t live my life right.\u2019 I don\u2019t have what really matters. What really matters is to have people pay attention to you, listen to you, and respect you, show you that you matter, and to love you. And to have it be genuine, not bought. Does that makes sense?<\/p>\n<p>And I\u2019ll leave you my last bit of wisdom. There\u2019s another proverb, it\u2019s a Turkish Proverb. \u2018No road is long with good company.\u2019 The essence of life is to surround yourself, as continuously as you can, with good company. Like I have today. You\u2019re marvelous company. But how did I get that? I had to earn it, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019m not just some guy you picked off the street. I earned the privilege of coming here and the privilege of being with you. It gives me what? It gives me meaning in my life. It makes me feel I matter. To have people listening to me. This is my strategy for getting those five thing. You can develop your own strategy and I hope it involves going positive and going first.
