Heller responds, \u201cYes, but I have something he will never have . . . <em>Enough<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Enough<\/em>. I was stunned by its simple eloquence, to say nothing of its relevance to some of the vital issues arising in American society today. Many of them revolve around money\u2014yes, money\u2014increasingly, in our \u201cbottom line\u201d society, the Great God of prestige, the Great Measure of the Man (and Woman). So this morning I have the temerity to ask you soon-to-be-minted MBA graduates, most of whom will enter the world of commerce, to consider with me the role of \u201cenough\u201d in business and entrepreneurship in our society, \u201cenough\u201d in the dominant role of the financial system in our economy, and \u201cenough\u201d in the values you will bring to the fields you choose for your careers.<\/p>\n<p>Kurt Vonnegut loved to speak to college students. He believed, if I may paraphrase here, that \u201cwe should catch young people before they become CEOs, investment bankers, consultants, and money managers (and especially hedge fund managers), and do our best to poison their minds with humanity.\u201d And in my remarks this morning, I\u2019ll try to poison your minds with a little bit of that humanity.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past two centuries, our nation has moved from being an agricultural economy, to a manufacturing economy, to a service economy, and now to a predominantly financial economy. But our financial economy, by definition, subtracts from the value created by our productive businesses. Think about it: while the owners of business enjoy the dividend yields and earnings growth that our capitalistic system creates, those who play in the financial markets capture those investment gains only <em>after<\/em> the costs of financial intermediation are deducted. Thus, while investing in American business is a <em>winner\u2019s<\/em> game, beating the stock market before those costs is a zero-sum game. But after intermediation costs are deducted, beating the market\u2014for all of us as a group\u2014becomes a <em>loser\u2019s game<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the more that our financial system <em>takes<\/em>, the less our investors <em>make<\/em>. Yet the financial field is where the money is made in modern-day America, the breeding ground for the wealthiest of our citizens. (If you made less than $140 million dollars last year, you didn\u2019t make <em>enough<\/em> to rank among the 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers.) When we add up all those hedge fund fees, all those mutual fund management fees and operating expenses; all those commissions to brokerage firms and fees to financial advisors; investment banking and legal fees for all those mergers and IPOs; and the enormous marketing and advertising expenses entailed in the distribution of financial products, we\u2019re talking about some $500 billion dollars <em>per year<\/em>. That sum, extracted from whatever returns the stock and bond markets are generous enough to deliver to investors, is surely <em>enough<\/em>, if you will, to seriously undermine the odds in favor of success for our citizens who are accumulating savings for retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the fact is that the finance sector has become by far our nation\u2019s largest generator of corporate profits, larger even than the <em>combined<\/em> profits of our huge energy and health care sectors, and almost three <em>times<\/em> as much as either manufacturing or information technology.<a href=\"#footnote-2-38591\" id=\"note-2-38591\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a> Twenty\u2013five years ago, financials accounted for only about 6 percent of the earnings of the 500 giant corporations that compose the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 Stock Index. Ten years ago, the financial sector share had risen to 20 percent. And last year, the financial sector profits had soared to an all-time high of 27 percent. If we add the earnings of the financial affiliates of our giant manufacturers (think General Electric Capital, for example, or the auto financing arms of&nbsp;General Motors and Ford) to this total, financial earnings now likely exceed 33 percent of the earnings of the S&amp;P 500. While that share may or may not be <em>enough<\/em>, it seems likely to continue to grow, at least for a while.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re moving, or so it seems, to a world where we\u2019re no longer <em>making<\/em> anything in this country; we\u2019re merely <em>trading<\/em> pieces of paper, swapping stocks and bonds back and forth with one another, and paying our financial croupiers a veritable fortune. We\u2019re also adding even more costs by creating ever more complex financial derivatives in which huge and unfathomable risks are being built into our financial system. \u201cWhen enterprise becomes a mere bubble on a whirlpool of speculation,\u201d as the great British economist John Maynard Keynes warned us 70 years ago, the consequences may be dire. \u201cWhen the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job of capitalism is likely to be ill-done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once a profession in which business was subservient, the field of money management and Wall Street has become a business in which the profession is subservient. Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana was right when he defined the conduct of a true professional with these words: \u201c<em>I will create value for society, rather than extract it.<\/em>\u201d And yet money management, by definition, extracts value from the returns earned by our business enterprises. Warren Buffett\u2019s wise partner Charlie Munger lays it on the line:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u201cMost money-making activity contains profoundly antisocial effects . . . As high cost modalities become ever more popular . . . the activity exacerbates the current harmful trend in which ever more of the nation\u2019s ethical young brain-power is attracted into lucrative money-management and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work providing much more value to others.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019m not telling you <em>not<\/em> to go into the highly-profitable field of managing money. Rather, I present three caveats:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One, if you do enter this field, do so with your eyes wide open, recognizing that any endeavor that extracts value from its clients may, in times more troubled than these, find that it has been hoist by its own petard. It is said on Wall Street, correctly, that \u201cmoney has no conscience,\u201d but don\u2019t allow that truism to let you ignore your own conscience, nor to alter your own conduct and character.<\/li>\n<li>Two, when you begin to invest so that you will have enough for your own retirement many decades hence, do so in a way that minimizes the extraction by the financial community of the returns generated by business. This is, yes, a sort of self serving<a href=\"#footnote-3-38591\" id=\"note-3-38591\" rel=\"footnote\">3<\/a> recommendation to invest in low-cost all-U.S.\u2014and global\u2014stock market index funds, the only way to guarantee your fair share of whatever returns our financial markets are generous enough to provide.<\/li>\n<li>&nbsp;Three, no matter what career you choose, do your best to hold high its traditional professional values, now swiftly eroding, in which serving the client is <em>always<\/em> the highest priority. And don\u2019t ignore the greater good of your community, your nation, and your world. After William Penn, \u201cwe pass through this world but once, so do now any good you can do, and show now any kindness you can show, for we shall not pass this way again.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most commencement speakers like to sum up by citing some eminent philosopher to endorse his message. I\u2019m no exception. So I now offer to you new Masters of Business Administration these words from Socrates, spoken 2500 years ago, as he challenged the citizens of Athens.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u201cI honor and love you: but why do you who are citizens of this great and mighty nation care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul. Are you not ashamed of this? . . . I do nothing but go about persuading you all, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I close by returning to Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s story, which, when I finally tracked it down, turned out to be a poem. It\u2019s delightful; even better, it\u2019s only 92 words long:<\/p>\n<p>True story, Word of Honor:<br \/>\nJoseph Heller, an important and funny writer<br \/>\nnow dead,<br \/>\nand I were at a party given by a billionaire<br \/>\non Shelter Island.<br \/>\nI said, \u201cJoe, how does it make you feel<br \/>\nto know that our host only yesterday<br \/>\nmay have made more money<br \/>\nthan your novel \u2018Catch-22\u2019<br \/>\nhas earned in its entire history?\u201d<br \/>\nAnd Joe said, \u201cI\u2019ve got something he can never have.\u201d<br \/>\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat on earth could that be, Joe?\u201d<br \/>\nAnd Joe said, \u201cThe knowledge that I\u2019ve got enough.\u201d<br \/>\nNot bad! Rest in Peace!<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not time for any of <em>you<\/em> to rest in peace, or to rest in any other way. Bright futures lie before you. There\u2019s the world\u2019s work to be done, and there are never enough citizens with determined hearts, courageous character, intelligent minds, and idealistic souls to do it. Yes, our world already has quite enough guns, political platitudes, arrogance, disingenuousness, self interest, snobbishness, superficiality, war, and the certainty that God is on one side or the other. But it <em>never<\/em> has enough conscience, nor enough tolerance, idealism, justice, compassion, wisdom, humility, self-sacrifice for the greater good, integrity, courtesy, poetry, laughter, and generosity of substance and spirit. It is these elements that I urge you to carry into your careers, and remember that the great game of life is not about money; it is about doing your best to build the world anew.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s enough . . . at least for today.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-38591\" class=\"footnote\"><p>This talk was originally published on <a href=\"http:\/\/johncbogle.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/05\/Georgetown_2007.pdf\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">John C.
