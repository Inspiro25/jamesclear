Decision making is just what it sounds like: the action or process of making decisions.\u00a0Sometimes we make logical decisions, but there are many times when we make emotional, irrational, and confusing choices. This page covers why we make poor decisions and discusses useful frameworks to expand your decision-making toolbox.<\/p>\n<h2>Why We Make Poor Decisions<\/h2>\n<p>I like to think of myself as a rational person, but I\u2019m not one. The good news is it\u2019s not just me \u2014 or you. We are all irrational. For a long time, researchers and economists believed that humans made logical, well-considered decisions. In recent decades, however, researchers have uncovered a wide range of mental errors that derail our thinking. The articles below outline where we often go wrong and\u00a0what to do about it.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/common-mental-errors\">5 Common Mental Errors That Sway You From Making Good Decisions<\/a>: Let&#8217;s talk about the mental errors that show up most frequently in our lives and break them down in easy-to-understand language. This article outlines how survivorship bias, loss aversion, the availability heuristic, anchoring, and confirmation bias sway you from making good decisions.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/illusory-correlation\">How to Spot a Common Mental Error That Leads to Misguided Thinking<\/a>:\u00a0Hundreds of psychology studies have proven that we tend to overestimate the importance of events we can easily recall and underestimate the importance of events we have trouble recalling.\u00a0Psychologists refer to this little brain mistake as an \u201cillusory correlation.\u201d In this article, we talk about a simple strategy you can use to spot your hidden assumptions and prevent yourself from making an illusory correlation.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/time-inconsistency\">Two Harvard Professors Reveal One Reason Our Brains Love to Procrastinate<\/a>:\u00a0We have a tendency to care too much about our present selves and not enough about our future selves.\u00a0If you want to beat procrastination and make better long-term choices, then you have to find a way to make your present self act in the best interest of your future self. This article breaks down three simple ways to do just that.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to Use Mental Models for Smart Decision Making<\/h2>\n<p>The smartest way to improve your decision making skills is to learn mental models. A mental model is a framework or theory that helps to explain why the world works the way it does. Each mental model is a concept that helps us make sense of the world and offers a way of looking at the problems of life.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/feynman-mental-models\">more about mental models<\/a>, read <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/feynman-mental-models\">how Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman uses mental models<\/a>, or browse a few of the most important mental models below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Top Mental Models to Improve Your Decision Making<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Margin of Safety: Always Leave Room for the Unexpected\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/margin-of-safety\">Margin of Safety: Always Leave Room for the Unexpected<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"How to Solve Difficult Problems by Using the Inversion Technique\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/inversion\">How to Solve Difficult Problems by Using the Inversion Technique<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Elon Musk and Bill Thurston on the Power of Thinking for Yourself\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/first-principles\">Elon Musk and Bill Thurston on the Power of Thinking for Yourself<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Best Decision Making Books<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/thinking-fast-and-slow\">Thinking, Fast and Slow<\/a> by Daniel Kahneman<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/poor-charlies-almanack\">Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack<\/a>\u00a0by Charles T.
