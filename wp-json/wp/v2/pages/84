The central question I explore through my work is, \u201cHow can we live better?&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, I want to find great ideas and explain them in a way that is easy to use and apply to daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My writing focuses on topics like&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How to start (and stick to) good habits<\/li><li>How to make good choices and avoid bad ones<\/li><li>How to accomplish more in less time<\/li><li>How to create better systems and processes<\/li><li>How to achieve meaningful results without overwhelming yourself<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of all, I write about how to put these ideas into practice in daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the concepts I write about aren\u2019t my own. They are ideas I discover and build upon after many hours of reading and research. I look for insights from all fields: architecture, biology, economics, history, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and more. I consider it my job to find the best ideas and explain them in a way that is actionable and easy-to-understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humankind progresses by adding layer upon layer of knowledge. We all benefit from the insights of our ancestors. I like the idea of leaving a great &#8220;intellectual inheritance,&#8221; and I\u2019m trying to add a little bit of knowledge to the pile by creating this website and sharing my work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t claim to have all the answers and I still have a lot to learn, but I&#8217;m happy to share what I&#8217;ve discovered so far. My work isn\u2019t the only way to think about life, but it\u2019s how I think about it. Hopefully, you\u2019ll find it useful as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start by reading <a href=\"\/articles\">my articles<\/a> or <a href=\"\/books\">check out my books<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-about-me\">About Me<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few notable things about me&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-author-of-the-international-bestselling-book-atomic-habits\"><strong>Author<\/strong> of the international bestselling book, <a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\">Atomic Habits<\/a>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Over 20 million copies sold worldwide.<\/li><li>Over 200+ weeks on the <em>New York Times<\/em> bestseller list.<\/li><li>Translated into 60+ languages.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-creator-of-jamesclear-com-and-the-popular-3-2-1-weekly-newsletter\"><strong>Creator of jamesclear.vercel.app and the popular <\/strong><a href=\"\/3-2-1\">3-2-1 weekly newsletter<\/a>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Over 250 articles published.<\/li><li>Over 3 million email subscribers.<\/li><li>Over 10 million visitors per year to jamesclear.vercel.app.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-speaker-at-major-companies-and-events\"><strong>Speaker<\/strong> at major companies and events.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I deliver 1-2 speeches per month about habits and continuous improvement.<\/li><li>Previous clients include American Express, AT&amp;T, Cisco, Disney, ESPN, Google, Honda, IKEA, Microsoft, State Farm, and many more.<\/li><li>If you are interested in having me speak at your event, <a href=\"\/keynote-speaker\">please click here to submit a request.<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-former-athlete-and-weightlifter\"><strong>Former athlete and weightlifter<\/strong>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I played baseball in college.
