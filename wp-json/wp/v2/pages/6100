A result of your habits. How happy or unhappy you are? A result of your habits. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">How successful or unsuccessful you are? A result of your habits. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">What you repeatedly do (i.e. what you spend time thinking about and doing each day) ultimately forms the person you are, the things you believe, and the personality that you portray.&nbsp;<\/span>Everything I write about \u2013 from <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/procrastination\">procrastination<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/productivity\">productivity<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/strength-training\">strength<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/eat-healthy\">nutrition<\/a> \u2013 starts with better habits.
