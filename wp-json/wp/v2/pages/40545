When you think about the change you want to make, your excitement and motivation can convince you to do too much, too soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone\u2019s heard things like: start small, take baby steps. But even when you know you should start small, it\u2019s still easy to start too big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why, if I have to recommend one place to start when building a new habit, I would recommend choosing a habit that is as easy as possible to perform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most effective way I know to do this is to follow the \u201c<strong>Two-Minute Rule<\/strong>.\u201d The Two-Minute Rule states, \u201cWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last lesson, you chose a habit that will cast votes for your desired identity. In this lesson, we\u2019ll take that habit and scale it down into a two-minute version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\u201cWalk 10,000 steps each day\u201d becomes \u201cPut on my running shoes.\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cKeep the house tidy\u201d becomes \u201cput one item of dirty clothing in the laundry.\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cBe a better partner\u201d becomes \u201cmake my partner a cup of coffee every morning.\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cGet straight A\u2019s\u201d becomes \u201cset my books out on the desk when I get home.\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. The Two-Minute Rule helps counterbalance our tendency to bite off more than we can chew. It also gives you a small way to reinforce your desired identity each day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When all we hear about are other people\u2019s spectacular results, it\u2019s natural to think that we need to push ourselves to the limit to achieve anything worthwhile. I know, I&#8217;ve made that mistake many times myself. Instead, you can simplify the process by narrowing your attention to the first movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may not be able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless. You\u2019re trying to build a \u201c<strong>gateway habit\u201d<\/strong> for a larger behavior or bigger ambition that you\u2019re ultimately working toward. Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from \u201cvery easy\u201d to \u201cvery hard.\u201d Most people start with ambitions that are big and very hard, but need to transition to habits that are small and very easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, learning to play a song on the guitar is very hard. Learning to play the chorus of a song is very difficult. Learning to play the scales is moderately difficult. Practicing the chords is easy. Picking up the guitar and sitting down in a quiet spot is very easy. Your ultimate ambition might be to learn to play a full song, but your gateway habit is picking up your guitar and sitting down in a quiet place where you can practice. That\u2019s how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even broad life goals can be transformed into a two-minute behavior. Wanting to live a healthy life may be your ultimate ambition, but then you can ask \u201cwhat do I need to live a healthy life\u201d \u2013 I need to stay in shape. Then you can ask what do I need to stay in shape \u2013 I need to exercise. What do I need to do to exercise? I need to change into my workout clothes. And so on until you get to a behavior that takes two minutes or less \u2013 until you discover the first movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in this case, putting on your workout clothes becomes your two-minute habit that moves you toward your ultimate ambition of living a healthy life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, wanting to have a happy marriage may be your ultimate ambition. So ask \u201cwhat do I need to have a happy marriage?\u201d You need to be a good partner. Then ask how you can be a good partner. You could do something each day to make your partner feel cared for. Something that makes their life easier. How could you make your partner\u2019s life easier? You could make their morning coffee for them\u2026 and so on, searching for small ways to move toward your ultimate ambition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often think it\u2019s weird to get hyped about putting on your shoes, or placing one item of clothing in the laundry basket, or making one cup of coffee, or setting your books out on the desk. But the point is not to do two minutes of work and then never do anything else. The point is to master the art of showing up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s one example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had one reader who told me, \u201cWhen I was getting back into the gym after being away for two years I told myself all I needed to do is get to the gym with my bag and stay for ten minutes, then I&#8217;m free to go home if I want.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It ended up working. He reclaimed his fitness habit and began exercising consistently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can\u2019t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. For the reader that I just mentioned, it wasn\u2019t even about exercising. He could walk into the lobby of the gym, sit down and read a book. He could go over to a workout station, set it up as if he were going to lift and not actually do any reps. He can\u2019t do this forever of course, but in the beginning, the idea is to get comfortable with simply being in the gym. To become the type of person who goes to the gym four days per week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I say in <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/atomic-habits\"><em>Atomic Habits<\/em><\/a>: standardization before optimization. Make it the standard in your life, then worry about doing it better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategies like this work for another reason too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row\u2014even if it\u2019s just for two minutes\u2014you are casting votes for your new identity. You\u2019re casting votes for the type of person who doesn\u2019t miss workouts. You\u2019re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all for Lesson 2.
