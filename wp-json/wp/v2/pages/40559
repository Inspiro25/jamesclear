My answer is nearly always to focus on one habit. Not only is this simpler, but it also addresses an often overlooked aspect of habit formation: when you\u2019re building one habit, you\u2019re often building multiple habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the habit of eating healthier. There are actually a variety of habits involved in this process. You have to build the habit of going to the grocery store and shopping for new items, the habit of meal planning and deciding what to eat each week, the habit of chopping and prepping food each night, the habit of cleaning up after the meal, and so on. Eating a healthy meal is actually the easiest part. It\u2019s often the preparation that causes you to quit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is true for many habits \u2013 not just eating healthy. One way to increase the odds that your habits will be performed is to walk into an environment that is ready for the habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I call this strategy \u201c<strong>priming the environment<\/strong>.\u201d That is, creating an environment that favors the habit that you\u2019re trying to build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Environment design, as we discussed in Lesson 4, makes the cues of good habits more obvious. Reducing friction, as discussed in Lesson 5, makes performing habits in the moment easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priming the environment adds one more layer: it\u2019s a way to make your future habits easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Want to meditate more? Set up a comfortable, quiet place in your home where you practice meditation.<\/li><li>Want to encourage your children to read more? Help them make a reading nook in their bedroom with some comfy pillows and plenty of age-appropriate reading material.<\/li><li>Want to paint more? Set up your easel, paints, and brushes beforehand so you can walk in and get straight to work.<\/li><li>Want to sleep better and develop a wind-down routine? Move your phone charger out of the bedroom and place a white noise machine, your favorite candle, and a couple of books on your nightstand.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make your future actions easy. Now your environment is ready for immediate use the next time around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same questions: \u201cHow can we design a world where it\u2019s easy to do what\u2019s right? How can we prime our environments so our future habits are easier?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, the actions that matter most should also be the actions that are easiest to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-week-2-summary\"><strong>Week 2 Summary<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, you need to make the cue a big part of your environment.<\/li><li>The less friction associated with a habit, the more likely it is to occur. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. You want to make your good habits the path of least resistance.<\/li><li>One way to increase the odds that your habits will be performed is to walk into an environment that is ready for the habit. Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make your future actions easy.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-week-2-progress-check-in\"><strong>Week 2 Progress Check-In<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is now the end of the second week. At this point, you have a two-minute habit, a clear plan for where and when to add that habit into your life, and a series of small environmental changes that make it easier to stick to your habit each day.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all for Lesson 6.
