I had never heard of Hamming, the internal lecture series at Bell Labs, or this particular speech. And yet, as I read the transcript, I came across one useful insight after another.<\/p>\n<p>After reading that talk, I got to thinking&#8230; what other great talks and speeches are out there that I&#8217;ve never heard?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly searching for answers to that question and the result is this list of my favorite interesting and insightful talks that are not widely known. You may see a few famous speeches on this list, but my guess is that most people are not aware of many of them\u2014just as I wasn&#8217;t when I first started looking around.<\/p>\n<p>As far as I know this is the only place where you can read transcripts of these speeches in one place.<\/p>\n<h2>Famous Speeches and Great Talks<\/h2>\n<p>This list is organized by presenter name and then speech topic.
