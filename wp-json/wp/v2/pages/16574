Grit is\u00a0the perseverance and passion to achieve long\u2013term goals. Sometimes you will hear grit referred to as mental toughness. Angela Duckworth, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that grit is a strong predictor of\u00a0success and ability to reach one&#8217;s goals.<\/p>\n<p>Duckworth&#8217;s research on grit has shown that\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>West Point cadets who scored highest on the Grit Test were 60% more likely to succeed than their peers.<\/li>\n<li>Ivy League undergraduate students who had more grit also had higher GPAs than their peers \u2014 even though they had lower SAT scores and weren\u2019t as \u201csmart.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>When comparing two people who are the same age but have different levels of education, grit (and not intelligence) more accurately predicts which one will be better educated.<\/li>\n<li>Competitors in the National Spelling Bee outperform their peers not because of IQ, but because of their grit and commitment to more consistent practice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(If you&#8217;d like more, <a title=\"mental toughness\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/mental-toughness\">I wrote about Duckworth&#8217;s research here<\/a>.)<br \/>\n<a name=\"video\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A Video Explanation of Grit<\/h3>\n<p>This short TED talk by psychology professor Angela Duckworth explains the concept of grit and how it helps foster mental toughness in our everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/H14bBuluwB8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0;iv_load_policy=3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>How to Be Mentally Tough<\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Step 1: Define what grit or mental toughness means for you.<\/h3>\n<p>For you, it might be\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>going one month without missing a workout<\/li>\n<li>delivering your work ahead of schedule for two days in a row<\/li>\n<li>calling one friend to catch up every Saturday this month<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whatever it is, be clear about what you\u2019re going after.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Step 2: Build grit with small physical wins.<\/h3>\n<p>So often we think that grit is about how we respond to extreme situations, but what about everyday circumstances?<\/p>\n<p>Mental toughness is like a muscle.

It\u2019s about doing the things you know you\u2019re supposed to do on a more consistent basis.
