She believed she could improve the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way.<a href=\"#footnote-1-5478\" id=\"note-1-5478\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a> In fact, she didn\u2019t plan on talking to them at all.<\/p>\n<p>Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the \u201cchoice architecture\u201d of the hospital cafeteria. They started by changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option each one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations.<\/p>\n<p>The image below depicts what the room looked like before the changes (Figure A) and after the changes (Figure B). The dark boxes indicate areas where bottled water is available.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5479\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5479\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5479\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/choice-architecture.png\" alt=\"choice architecture\" width=\"700\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/choice-architecture.png 990w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/choice-architecture-768x496.png 768w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/choice-architecture-300x193.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5479\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Source: American Journal of Public Health, April 2012.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>What happened?<\/p>\n<p>Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by 25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments\u2014and saw similar results\u2014with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.<\/p>\n<p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.<a href=\"#footnote-2-5478\" id=\"note-2-5478\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a> If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I\u2019ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn\u2019t been thinking about them beforehand and didn\u2019t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it\u2019s going to be hard to not grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.<\/p>\n<p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.<\/p>\n<h2>To Change Your Behavior, Change Your Environment<\/h2>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make it easy to <span class=\"ITAL\">not<\/span> do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It\u2019s easy to <em><span class=\"ITAL\">not<\/span> <\/em>practice guitar when it\u2019s tucked away in the closet. It\u2019s easy to <em><span class=\"ITAL\">not<\/span><\/em> read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It\u2019s easy to<em> <span class=\"ITAL\">not<\/span><\/em> take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don\u2019t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of stationery on your desk.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend smoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you\u2019ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.<\/p>\n<p>Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. \u00a0Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world, and not merely the consumer of it.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article is an excerpt from Chapter 6 of my New York Times bestselling book\u00a0Atomic\u00a0Habits.\u00a0<a title=\"Read more here\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/atomic-habits\">Read more here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-5478\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Anne N.
