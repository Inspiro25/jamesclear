Or maybe you&#8217;re getting started with exercise for the first time and don&#8217;t know how to start working out. Either way, starting a new training routine is something we all deal with from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I recently added sprint training to my workout routine. There\u2019s just one problem: I\u2019ve never done sprint training before.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll outline the strategies I used to get started with a new training routine and show you how to start working out.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>How to Start Working Out<\/h2>\n<h6><strong>1.Decide what you want to be good at doing.<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>I\u2019ve written previously about how important a sense of purpose can be, and that holds true for exercise and training as well.<\/p>\n<p>The more specific you are about what you want to become good at doing, the easier it is for you to train for success. In my case, I want to become good at 400m sprints. That\u2019s a clear goal and it helps provide direction to me in the process.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re confused about how to start working out, then make a decision. It doesn&#8217;t even have to be the &#8220;best&#8221; decision. Just choose something that you want to become good at doing and start moving in that direction. There will be plenty of time for adjustments and optimization later.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>2. Ask someone who has been there.<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>In the beginning, I had no idea what a typical sprint workout even looked like.<\/p>\n<p>How did I find out? I asked people who did know. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out and ask questions. Everybody is a beginner at some point. The people around you are your greatest asset.<\/p>\n<p>I went to my strength and conditioning coach from college, my old teammates who had done sprint training, and a friend who ran track competitively. I asked each of them for suggestions and programs for 400m sprint training and for general sprinting tips.<\/p>\n<p>My hope was that by asking five different people instead of just one, I would get a more well-rounded view. As expected, everyone pointed me towards different programs and routines.<\/p>\n<p>While all of this different information might seem conflicting and confusing at first, it&#8217;s important for the next step.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>3. Get the main idea, skip the details.<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>This is where most people give up and never get going with their new routine. (Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s happened to me as well.)<\/p>\n<p>Fitness is one of the worst industries if you&#8217;re looking for clear advice. It seems like everyone has a different way of doing things and they are all convinced that their way is the only way.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, it\u2019s easy to stress out over the details of a new workout routine. Should I do 5 sets or 6 sets? Program A says I should rest for 90 seconds, but Program B says I should rest for 60 seconds. This website says to workout on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, but my friend did it on Tuesday and Thursday. Which one is right?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s all take a deep breath.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little knowledge bomb for you: <strong>the details don\u2019t matter in the beginning.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out technique, rest periods, volume, training schedules, yada yada yada. When you\u2019re starting a new workout routine, the only thing that matters is getting started. Get the main idea, stick to the schedule, and the details will begin to fall into place.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I did it with my sprint training&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I read each of the resources and workout programs that my friends sent me. Then, I wrote down the common ideas from each program.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what they looked like&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>run sprints that range from 200m to 500m<\/li>\n<li>rest for 2 or 3 minutes between sets<\/li>\n<li>run between 3 to 6 sprints per workout<\/li>\n<li>do sprint workouts 2 or 3 times per week<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Did I leave out a lot of details? Yes. But with the main ideas above, I could go to the track and get my first sprint workout done.<\/p>\n<p>And in the beginning that\u2019s the real goal: <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/domino-effect\">make it as simple as possible to get started<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>4. Go slow.<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Most of the time, when we decide to start a new workout routine it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re motivated to do it. It&#8217;s great to have <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/motivation\">motivation<\/a>, but as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, it can be a double-edged sword.<\/p>\n<p>Why? First, because motivation fluctuates. This means you can&#8217;t rely on it. That&#8217;s why you want to build good habits instead of getting motivated.<\/p>\n<p>But secondly, motivation can fool you into biting off more than you can chew. (I wrote about why this is an issue, and how to avoid it, <a title=\"good habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/why-is-it-so-hard-to-form-good-habits\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, you want to start slow. Remember, the goal is to get in the habit of doing the workouts, not to do intense workouts.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I started with my sprints&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The first workout, I did 3 sprints of 200m at 50% intensity. It was easy and slow. I was simply trying to get my body used to running again.<\/p>\n<p>The second workout, I did 2 sprints of 400m with 3 minutes rest in between. Again, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly taxing workout.<\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, you want the workouts to be easy. This is true for the first 3 or 4 weeks. Your only goal is to stick to the schedule and build the capacity to do the workout. Performance doesn\u2019t matter.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like this is the exact opposite of what most people do. The typical approach is to go from sitting on your couch to doing P90X for six days every week. With a switch like that, it\u2019s no wonder that most people give up after a week.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>5. Don\u2019t miss workouts.<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>If I could summarize everything I\u2019ve learned in 10 years of strength training it would come down to these three words: <strong>don\u2019t miss workouts.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If we\u2019re being honest with ourselves, here\u2019s what our workout calendar usually looks like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workout consistently for a month or two.<\/li>\n<li>Get sick. Miss multiple workouts. Spend the next month getting back in shape.<\/li>\n<li>Workout consistently for a month or two.<\/li>\n<li>Schedule changes. Life gets crazy. Miss multiple workouts. Spend the next month getting back in shape.<\/li>\n<li>Workout consistently for a month or two.<\/li>\n<li>Travel. Vacation. Time off. Miss multiple workouts. Spend the next month getting back in shape.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And on and on.<\/p>\n<p>Now there\u2019s nothing wrong with your schedule changing or taking vacation, but you need to have a system to make it as easy as possible to <a title=\"get back on track\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/get-back-on-track\">get back on track<\/a>. This is especially true when you\u2019re just getting started with a new workout routine.<\/p>\n<p>When I started <a title=\"James Clear 100 pushups\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/ccc?key=0ApTNYzC_iYrtdGk5dGhydVJ4Zkt4cjY2MXg3T1VEOVE&amp;usp=sharing\">my pushup routine<\/a>, I managed to get 17 consecutive workouts in before I missed a day. And I got right back on track after that one day off. In total, I\u2019ve done 93 pushup workouts over the last 8 months.<\/p>\n<p>The individual impact of each workout has been very small, but the cumulative impact of sticking to that schedule has been huge. (I\u2019ve doubled the amount of pushups that I can do.) And it all comes down to not missing workouts.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m planning on applying this same strategy to my sprint workouts and I suggest you do the same.<\/p>\n<h6><strong>6. Pick an exercise and get started<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>There are more exercises in the world than I care to count, but I think you can list the important ones on two hands.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean and Jerk<\/li>\n<li>Snatch<\/li>\n<li>Squat<\/li>\n<li>Deadlift<\/li>\n<li>Bench Press<\/li>\n<li>Pushups<\/li>\n<li>Pullups<\/li>\n<li>Sprints<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pick one that you would like to be good at and get started.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, you don\u2019t need to worry about the details in the beginning. Just get the main idea, start slow, and don\u2019t miss workouts.<\/p>\n<p>And now if you\u2019ll excuse me, it\u2019s time to hit the track.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.\u00a0If you want more practical ideas for how to build new habits (and break bad ones), check out my book\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/book\/atomic-habits\"><em>Atomic<\/em> <em>Habits<\/em><\/a>, which will show you how small changes in habits can lead to remarkable results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do you do when you&#8217;re trying to start a new workout routine?
