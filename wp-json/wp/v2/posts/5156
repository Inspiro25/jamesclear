I definitely have.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about thoughts like&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Why bother applying? I doubt that school would ever accept me.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;This business idea isn&#8217;t going to work.

Why should I even ask?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell, we all doubt ourselves from time to time. The problem, of course, is that telling yourself no prevents you from getting started at all. When you decide not to act, you deny yourself opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Once I realized this, I started following a simple little rule that has helped me stick to things and persevere when I normally would have given up.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works and why you should use it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Give Up At The First &#8220;No&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Most of us will do just about anything to avoid failure. (Why do you think celebrities, congressmen, and athletes say and do so many stupid things to cover up scandals of all types? They desperately want to avoid failure as long as possible.)<\/p>\n<p>I think this is natural. Nobody wants to fail. On a smaller scale, you and I also want to prevent failure. And that&#8217;s why we come up with reasons for why we shouldn&#8217;t do things that we want to do. And it&#8217;s also why we abandon our ideas as soon as we get any type of negative feedback.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>No rarely means impossible. No rarely means never. Usually, if someone tells you &#8220;no&#8221; what they really mean is &#8220;not right now&#8221; or &#8220;not in that way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Keeping that in mind, I\u2019ve started to follow a simple rule that helps me get past negative feedback and gives me a little bit more perseverance when I would normally call it quits.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the rule: <strong>Don\u2019t give up at the first, &#8220;No.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s you telling yourself no. Maybe it\u2019s someone else shooting you down.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, don\u2019t stop the first time you hear no. Negative feedback is a signal to adjust your idea, not to abandon it. There\u2019s no reason to act as if you\u2019re destined to fail. Instead, use the word no as a trigger to tweak your approach.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Overcome the Fear of Failure<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>If you set your bar at &#8220;amazing,&#8221; it&#8217;s awfully difficult to start.<br \/>\n\u2014Seth Godin<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One common reason we tell ourselves no is because we don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ready yet. &#8220;I&#8217;m not experienced enough.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I need to learn more.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I need to figure out a better plan first.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We do this because we want to succeed right from the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>But, I\u2019m starting to realize that the time has come to abandon the need to be amazing in favor of taking action. You don\u2019t need to be fantastic at the start, you just need to <em>be there at the start<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>When you start your first business, you&#8217;ll probably make a thousand mistakes. When you write the first draft of your book, it will probably be terrible. When you ask someone out for the first time, you&#8217;ll probably say something stupid. When you go to the gym for the first time, you&#8217;ll probably feel out of place. When you surround yourself with people who are better than you, you&#8217;ll probably feel untalented or unintelligent.<\/p>\n<p>So. What.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in this for the long haul, then this won&#8217;t be the only time you do these things. There will be plenty of time to become amazing. Anything can happen once you <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/start-succeed\">get started<\/a>, but <em>only if you get started<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if you really want to, then you can dream up reasons for why now isn&#8217;t the right time, this isn&#8217;t the right place, and you&#8217;re not quite ready &#8230; but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s your job.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not your job to tell yourself no. It\u2019s not your job to deny yourself opportunities. It\u2019s not your job to prevent your own progress. There are enough people in the world who will do those things for you.<\/p>\n<p>Your job is to embrace rather than ignore. Your job is to pursue rather than prevent. Your job is to tell yourself &#8220;yes&#8221; instead of &#8220;no.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s your job.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever told yourself no?
