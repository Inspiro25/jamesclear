How intelligent do you need to be to become a successful entrepreneur? How good does your training program need to be to become an elite athlete?<\/p>\n<p>Most people don&#8217;t ask these questions specifically, but the ideas are built into the way we behave in many areas of life. We often think that the reason we aren&#8217;t succeeding is because we haven&#8217;t found the right strategy or because we weren&#8217;t born with the right talents.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps that is true. Or, perhaps there is an untold side of the story&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;The Termites&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>In 1921, there was a psychologist at Stanford University named <a title=\"Lewis Terman\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lewis_Terman\">Lewis Terman<\/a> who set out on a mission to conduct a research study unlike any before it.<\/p>\n<p>Terman began by finding the 1,000 smartest students in California between the third grade and eighth grade as measured by IQ.<a href=\"#footnote-1-6220\" id=\"note-1-6220\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a>\u00a0After much testing and searching, Terman gathered a final sample of 856 boys and 672 girls. The children became known as &#8220;The Termites.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Terman and his team began testing the children in nearly every way you could imagine. They tracked their IQ, analyzed how many books each student had in their homes, took their medical histories, and on and on. But that was just the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>What made Terman&#8217;s study unique is that it was the first longitudinal research study, which meant that Terman continued to track and test his subjects for years afterward. The study, which is now famously known as <em>Genetic Studies of Genius<\/em>, collected data from the students throughout their entire lives. Terman collected additional data in 1928, 1936, 1940, 1945, 1950, and 1955. After Terman died in 1956, his colleagues continued tracking The Termites in 1960, 1972, 1977, 1982, and 1986.<\/p>\n<p>To summarize, the study started with the smartest group of children in the entire state of California and then tracked their success throughout their entire lives. Decades later, the researchers had discovered something very interesting.<\/p>\n<h2>Threshold Theory<\/h2>\n<p>The surprising discovery that came out of Terman&#8217;s study is best described by creativity researcher and physician, Nancy Andreasen as Threshold Theory&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;Although many people continue to equate intelligence with genius, a crucial conclusion from Terman\u2019s study is that having a high IQ is not equivalent to being highly creative. Subsequent studies by other researchers have reinforced Terman\u2019s conclusions, leading to what\u2019s known as the threshold theory, which holds that above a certain level, intelligence doesn\u2019t have much effect on creativity: most creative people are pretty smart, but they don\u2019t have to be that smart, at least as measured by conventional intelligence tests. An IQ of 120, indicating that someone is very smart but not exceptionally so, is generally considered sufficient for creative genius.&#8221; <\/em><a href=\"#footnote-2-6220\" id=\"note-2-6220\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Being in the top one percent of intelligence has no correlation with being fantastically creative. Rather, there is a minimum threshold of intelligence that you need to have, and after that it comes down to a lot of <a title=\"deliberate practice\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/deliberate-practice\">deliberate practice<\/a>, <a title=\"repetitions\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/repetitions\">putting in your reps<\/a>, and <a title=\"skill set\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/ingvar-kamprad\">developing your skill set<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some psychology professors like to use the analogy of an NFL football player to explain the role of intelligence and success. If you were to analyze the productivity and effectiveness of all offensive lineman in the NFL and compare it to their weight, you would probably see results all over the board. It is very unlikely that the heaviest lineman in the NFL is also the best lineman. Productivity does not increase linearly with weight.<\/p>\n<p>But nearly every lineman in the NFL is over 300 pounds. There is a threshold that you have to cross to get the job. After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to who will be the best. We can think of intelligence in a similar fashion.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6221\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/threshold-theory.jpg\" alt=\"Threshold Theory\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Threshold Theory in Everyday Life<\/h2>\n<p>If you look around, you&#8217;ll see that Threshold Theory applies to many things in life. There is a minimum threshold of competence that you need to develop in nearly any endeavor. Success is rarely as simple as &#8220;just work harder.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that threshold, however, the difference is between those who put in the work and those who get distracted. Once you have a basic grasp of the right things to do, it becomes about the consistency of doing the right things more often. Once you understand the fundamentals, it comes down to your <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/habits\">habits<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some examples&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weightlifting:<\/strong> Assuming you&#8217;ve met some minimum threshold and are doing reasonably effective exercises (<a title=\"best exercises\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/best-exercises-basics\">like these<\/a>) with reasonably effective form, the details don&#8217;t really matter that much. Once you&#8217;ve passed this basic threshold, what makes 95% of the difference is this: Are you showing up to the gym and putting in your reps?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writing:<\/strong> Assuming you understand the core principles of writing and the basics of grammar, what determines your ability to write well more than anything else is writing a lot. Once you reach the threshold of writing a decent sentence, the thing that leads to success is writing more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurship:<\/strong> Assuming you know what the most important metric is for your business, what makes the biggest difference is focusing on that metric every day. Once you cross the basic threshold of knowing what to work on, the most important thing is continuing to work on that one thing and not something else.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re brand new to an area, then it&#8217;s possible you haven&#8217;t learned enough to cross the threshold yet. But for most of us, we know what works and we have enough knowledge to make progress. It&#8217;s not about being more intelligent or more skilled, it&#8217;s about overcoming distraction and doing the work that already works.<a href=\"#footnote-3-6220\" id=\"note-3-6220\" rel=\"footnote\">3<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-6220\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Interestingly, Terman actually created the IQ test that he used to determine the intelligence of his original group.
