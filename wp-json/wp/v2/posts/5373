He has finished as high as 4th at the national championships, has worked directly with Olympians, and routinely delivers Olympic weightlifting seminars through his work at <a title=\"Columbus Weightlifting\" href=\"http:\/\/www.columbusweightlifting.org\/\">Columbus Weightlifting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One day, Drew and I were in the gym when he told me about a group of athletes he was training.<\/p>\n<p>The athletes wanted to get stronger and Drew designed a program to help them do that. When he checked back a few weeks later, however, Drew found out that very few of them had stuck to the program. Instead, most of them had returned to endurance training.<\/p>\n<p>Now the athletes were frustrated because they still weren&#8217;t getting stronger.<\/p>\n<p>Drew finished telling me the story by saying&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I looked at them and said, \u201cWhen you want to cook something, do you follow the recipe?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course you do.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to bake a cake, then bake the damn cake. Don\u2019t cook a chicken and yell at it for not being a fish.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You say you want to get stronger. Are you following a recipe that will get you there?<\/p>\n<p>You say you want to lose weight. Are you following a recipe that will get you there?<\/p>\n<p>You say you want to build a business or write a book or travel somewhere new. Are you following a recipe that will get you there?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Finish Something<\/h2>\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not a fan of doing the same thing over and over again when it doesn\u2019t work. (If it\u2019s a bad recipe, why cook it twice?) But there is a big difference between a bad recipe and an unfinished recipe. The truth is, like the athletes in the story above, you and I often change course halfway through the recipe and never give ourselves the chance to see results.<\/p>\n<p>Examples include&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working out for a month and then trying something new because \u201cthis isn\u2019t working for me.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Jumping from project to project, half-finishing all of them, and completing none of them.<\/li>\n<li>Mapping out a business idea, working on it for a week or two, and then putting it on the shelf because \u201cthings got busy.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Switching your workout program after three weeks because you\u2019re \u201cnot seeing results\u201d is like mixing flour and eggs and then quitting because it doesn\u2019t look like a cookie yet.<\/p>\n<p>You have to be patient enough to finish the recipe if you want to see the results. Give your success time to cook. Follow the recipe and finish something.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My buddy Drew is an excellent weightlifter.
