Eventually, the student realized Agassiz\u2019s game: the teacher wanted him to observe the fish more deeply.<\/p>\n<p>After nearly one hundreds hours of study, the student began to notice finer details that had escaped his vision previously: how the scales of the fish were shaped and the patterns they made, the placement of the teeth, the shape of each individual tooth, and so on. When his teacher finally returned and the student explained all that he had learned, Agassiz replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d And walked out of the room. <a href=\"#footnote-2-10983\" id=\"note-2-10983\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Shocked and angry at first, the student eventually recommitted to the task with new vigor.

(Photographer: John Adams Whipple.)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>The Art of Comparing Objects<\/h2>\n<p>After his investigation of the sunfish Agassiz\u2019s student wrote, &#8220;I had learned the art of comparing objects.\u201d How does this tooth compare to the one next to it? How does this scale compare to the one on the opposite side? How does the symmetry of the bottom half of the fish compare to the top half?<\/p>\n<p>The art of comparing objects is a remarkably useful strategy in many areas of life. Take <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/why-lift-weights\">weightlifting<\/a>, for example.<\/p>\n<p>For the first five years that I lifted weights, I experienced mediocre results at best. I assumed that it was information that held me back. Like many people, I thought that once I found the right workout routine, then I would be set. I was under the assumption that I simply hadn\u2019t reached the next level yet because I hadn\u2019t come across the right information. What I didn&#8217;t realize was my search for the perfect pre-made formula was preventing me from observing my actual results.<\/p>\n<p>When I started to observe with greater care and focus, I realized that my body tended to respond better to higher volume rather than higher intensity. I noticed that my foundational strength in major movements like the squat and deadlift was lacking. I was able to use these observational discoveries to tailor my training to my needs and, subsequently, make much greater strides because of it. It was through comparing what I was doing with what was actually working for me that I made progress.<\/p>\n<h2>Do the Work For Yourself<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI never pay attention to anything by &#8216;experts.&#8217; I calculate everything myself.&#8221;<br \/>\n-Richard Feynman<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/feynman-mental-models\">Richard Feynman<\/a>, the brilliant physicist, was working on a new theory of beta decay he noticed something surprising. For years, experts had been saying that beta decay occurred in a particular way, but when Feynman actually ran the experiments he kept getting a different result.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, Feynman investigated the original data that all of the experts were basing their theory on and discovered that the study was flawed. For years, nobody had bothered to read or repeat the original study! All of the experts just kept quoting one another and used their mutual opinions as justification for the theory. Then Feynman came along and turned everything upside simply because he did the calculations himself. <a href=\"#footnote-4-10983\" id=\"note-4-10983\" rel=\"footnote\">4<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Look, And See for Yourself<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Take the facts into your own hands; look, and see for yourself!&#8221;<br \/>\n-Louis Agassiz<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Pick any industry of life and you\u2019ll find that very few people actually <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/required-for-success\">do the work<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than read the original study, most people cite the headline from a secondary source. Rather than spend 100 hours observing every detail of a fish, most biology students would look up the description of the fish online. When most people say, \u201cI read an article on climate change,\u201d what they really mean is, \u201cI read the title of an article on climate change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly why <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/stay-focused\">doing the boring work more consistently<\/a> is actually a competitive advantage.
