It was led by a physician named Peter Pronovost and later popularized by writer Atul Gawande. <a href=\"#footnote-1-9241\" id=\"note-1-9241\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In Gawande&#8217;s best-selling book, <a title=\"The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right by Atul Gawande\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/the-checklist-manifesto\">The Checklist Manifesto<\/a> (<a title=\"The Checklist Manifesto audiobook\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/audiobook\/the-checklist-manifesto\">audiobook<\/a>), he describes how Pronovost&#8217;s simple checklist could drive such dramatic results. In the following quote, Gawande explains one of the checklists that was used to reduce the risk of infection when installing a central line in a patient (a relatively common procedure).<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>On a sheet of plain paper, [Pronovost] plotted out the steps to take in order to avoid infections when putting a line in. Doctors are supposed to (1) wash their hands with soap, (2) clean the patient\u2019s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic, (3) put sterile drapes over the entire patient, (4) wear a sterile mask, hat, gown, and gloves, and (5) put a sterile dressing over the catheter site once the line is in. Check, check, check, check, check.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>These steps are no-brainers; they have been known and taught for years. So it seemed silly to make a checklist just for them. Still, Pronovost asked the nurses in his I.C.U. to observe the doctors for a month as they put lines into patients, and record how often they completed each step. In more than a third of patients, they skipped at least one.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This five-step checklist was the simple solution that Michigan hospitals used to save 1,500 lives. Think about that for a moment. There were no technical innovations. There were no pharmaceutical discoveries or cutting-edge procedures. The physicians just stopped skipping steps. They implemented the answers they already had on a more consistent basis.<\/p>\n<h2>New Solutions vs. Old Solutions<\/h2>\n<p>We have a tendency to undervalue answers that we have already discovered. We underutilize old solutions\u2014even if they are best practices\u2014because they seem like something we have already considered.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the problem: <em>&#8220;Everybody already knows that&#8221;<\/em> is very different from <em>&#8220;Everybody already does that.&#8221;<\/em> Just because a solution is known doesn\u2019t mean it is utilized.<\/p>\n<p>Even more critical, just because a solution is implemented occasionally, doesn&#8217;t mean it is implemented consistently. Every physician knew the five steps on Peter Pronovost&#8217;s checklist, but very few did all five steps flawlessly each time.<\/p>\n<p>We assume that new solutions are needed if we want to make real progress, but that isn&#8217;t always the case.<\/p>\n<h2>Use What You Already Have<\/h2>\n<p>This pattern is just as present in our personal lives as it is in corporations and governments. We waste the resources and ideas at our fingertips because they don\u2019t seem new and exciting.<\/p>\n<p>There are many examples of behaviors, big and small, that have the opportunity to drive progress in our lives if we just did them with more consistency. Flossing every day. Never missing workouts. Performing fundamental business tasks each day, not just when you have time. Apologizing more often. <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/say-thank-you\">Writing Thank You notes each week<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these answers are boring. Mastering the fundamentals isn\u2019t sexy, but it works. No matter what task you are working on, there is a simple checklist of steps that you can follow right now\u2014basic fundamentals that you have known about for years\u2014that can immediately yield results if you just practice them more consistently.<\/p>\n<p>Progress often hides behind boring solutions and underused insights. You don\u2019t need more information. You don\u2019t need a better strategy. You just need to do more of what already works.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-9241\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Although he is one of my favorite authors, calling Gawande a writer is a bit of a misnomer.
