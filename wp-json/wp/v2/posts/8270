It is possible, for example, to watch TV while cooking dinner or to answer an email while talking on the phone.<\/p>\n<p>What is impossible, however, is <em>concentrating<\/em> on two tasks at once. Multitasking forces your brain to switch back and forth very quickly from one task to another.<\/p>\n<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal if the human brain could transition seamlessly from one job to the next, but it can&#8217;t. Multitasking forces you to pay a mental price each time you interrupt one task and jump to another. In psychology terms, this mental price is called the switching cost.<\/p>\n<p>Switching cost is the disruption in performance that we experience when we switch our attention from one task to another. A <a title=\"Reducing the effect of email interruptions on employees by Thomas Jackson, Ray Dawson, Darren Wilson\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/email-multitasking-study.pdf\">2003 study<\/a> published in the International Journal of Information Management found that the typical person checks email once every five minutes and that, on average, it takes 64 seconds to resume the previous task after checking your email.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, because of email alone, we typically waste one out of every six minutes.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8298\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8298\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8298\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/multitasking.jpg\" alt=\"The myth of multitasking is that it will make you more effective.

Today, people wear the word like a badge of honor as if it is better to be busy with all the things than to be great at one thing.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding Your Anchor Task<\/h2>\n<p>Doing more things does not drive faster or better results. Doing better things drives better results. Even more accurately, doing one thing as best you can drives better results.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"How to stay focused when you get bored working on your goals.\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/stay-focused\">Mastery requires focus and consistency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t mastered the art of focus and concentration yet, but I&#8217;m working on it. One of the major improvements I&#8217;ve made recently is to assign one (and only one) priority to each work day. Although I plan to complete other tasks during the day, my priority task is the one non-negotiable thing that must get done.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what my current weekly schedule looks like&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday &#8211; Write article.<\/li>\n<li>Tuesday &#8211; Send two emails (one for networking, one for partnerships.)<\/li>\n<li>Wednesday &#8211; Write article.<\/li>\n<li>Thursday &#8211; Write article.<\/li>\n<li>Friday &#8211; Complete weekly review.<\/li>\n<li>Saturday &#8211; OFF<\/li>\n<li>Sunday &#8211; OFF<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The power of choosing <em>one<\/em> priority is that it naturally guides your behavior by forcing you to organize your life around that responsibility. Your priority becomes an anchor task, the mainstay that holds the rest of your day in place. If things get crazy, there is no debate about what to do or not to do. You have already decided <a title=\"Use the Eisenhower Box to master your priorities.\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/eisenhower-box\">what is urgent and what is important<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Saying No to Being Busy<\/h2>\n<p>As a society, we&#8217;ve fallen into a trap of busyness and overwork. In many ways, we have mistaken all this activity to be something meaningful. The underlying thought seems to be, <em>&#8220;Look how busy I am? If I&#8217;m doing all this work, I must be doing something important.&#8221;<\/em> And, by extension, <em>&#8220;I must be important because I&#8217;m so busy.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While I firmly believe everyone has worth and value, I think we&#8217;re kidding ourselves if we believe being busy is what drives meaning in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, meaning is derived from contributing something of value to your corner of the universe. And the more I study people who are able to do that, people who are masters of their craft, the more I notice that they have one thing in common. The people who do the most valuable work have a remarkable willingness to say no to distractions and focus on their one thing.<\/p>\n<p>I think we need to say no to being busy and say yes to being committed to our craft. What do you want to master? What is the one priority that anchors your life or work each day?<\/p>\n<p>If you commit to nothing <a title=\"mental toughness\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/mental-toughness-marathon-monks\">you\u2019ll be distracted by everything<\/a>. <a href=\"#footnote-2-8270\" id=\"note-2-8270\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-8270\" class=\"footnote\"><p>IBM Operating System\/360 Concepts and Facilities by Witt and Ward.
