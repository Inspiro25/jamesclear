A good Annual Review is also about looking toward the future and thinking about how the life I&#8217;m living now is building toward a bigger mission. Basically, my Annual Review forces me to look at my actions over the past 12 months and ask, &#8220;Are my choices helping me live the life I want to live?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And most importantly, the annual review is a personal process. It&#8217;s not about comparing how much or how little you did to someone else. It&#8217;s about your life, your actions, and what you want to do for yourself. In other words, keep your eyes on your own paper.<\/p>\n<p>There are 3 questions that I&#8217;m going to answer in my Annual Review (feel free to use these for your own annual review if you want).<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What went well this year?<\/li>\n<li>What didn&#8217;t go so well this year?<\/li>\n<li>What am I working toward?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s get this party started&#8230;<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>1. What went well this year?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Writing.<\/strong> After writing inconsistently for years, this was the year when I finally turned it around. I wrote a new article every Monday and Thursday in 2013. (I only missed one day all year, which happened when I was sick with food poisoning while traveling through Italy). My first article was published on November 12, 2012. I&#8217;m proud to say that since that time I have published <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/best-articles\">114 articles<\/a> on jamesclear.vercel.app and received 686,937 unique visitors. Best of all, 40,637 people have joined my <a title=\"James Clear free newsletter\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/newsletter\">free weekly newsletter<\/a>. (Thank You!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Travel.<\/strong> I visited 5 countries and 10 states this year. Internationally, I traveled to Austria, Italy, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and the United States. Within the USA, I visited California, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia. Overall, I\u2019m happy with the amount of travel in my life, but next year I plan to schedule more trips specifically for photography.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lifting.<\/strong> I&#8217;m slowly getting into better shape. In the beginning of the year, I was still relatively weak and out of shape, so I spent the first five months focusing on bodyweight exercises to build a foundation. Starting in late May, I went back to the gym and I haven&#8217;t missed a workout since. Again, I started with easy weights and slowly worked my way up each week. Rather than worrying about specific numbers, I was much better this year about committing to the process of training and getting better each week. I&#8217;m planning to share more details about my workouts during 2014.<\/p>\n<p>My best lifts of the year were&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snatch \u2014 165 lbs (75 kg) for 1 rep<\/li>\n<li>Clean and Jerk \u2014 255 lbs (115 kg) for 1 rep<\/li>\n<li>Back Squat \u2014 295 lbs (133 kg) for 10 reps<\/li>\n<li>Front Squat \u2014 240 lbs (108 kg) for 10 reps<\/li>\n<li>Bench Press \u2014 200 lbs (90 kg) for 11 reps<\/li>\n<li>Deadlift \u2014 405 lbs (183 kg) for 2 reps<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Mindset.<\/strong> I have been very achievement focused my entire life. This year, I made big strides toward becoming more process-oriented and <a title=\"goals and systems\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/goals-systems\">focusing on the system<\/a> rather than the goal. This was a major shift for me and the wonderful thing is that I\u2019m enjoying the process more than ever and the results are still there.<\/p>\n<h2>2. What didn&#8217;t go so well this year?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Creating products.<\/strong> Basically, I didn\u2019t do it. I have readers emailing me each week asking when my book is coming out. I have friends telling me every month that I need to launch a product. Maybe it\u2019s my own fears or mental barriers holding me back, but I haven\u2019t done it yet. I want to do it. I plan to do it. I just haven\u2019t executed. My writing every Monday and Thursday will always be free, but you can also expect multiple books and products in 2014.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Delegation and management.<\/strong> Again, I know I should delegate more tasks in my business, but I have delayed doing this for a long time. Last week, I finally stepped up and hired someone to handle a few tasks. Hopefully that will go well and I\u2019ll grow as a manager and leader over the next year. Building a team of people who believe in the mission is something I want to become better at in 2014.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Staying in touch with friends and family from afar.<\/strong> Thankfully, I see most of my family and friends in-person multiple times each year. But when we are far apart, my friends do a much better job of staying in touch with me than I do of staying in touch with them. I rarely call people first and often wait too long before calling them back. I\u2019m thinking of how I can schedule calls with friends and family into my calendar on a weekly basis in 2014. (My main worry is that my family and friends will think that it\u2019s too \u201cbusiness-like\u201d to schedule calls with the people you are close to personally.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Photography.<\/strong> I\u2019m not sure that I got better as a photographer this year. Mostly, it comes down to this: I didn\u2019t take enough photos. The only way to get better at the craft is to do the craft, and I spent too much time doing other things. I\u2019d like to fix this in 2014 by scheduling a handful of photography trips, which will be 4 to 10 days in length and specifically dedicated to taking photos. You can be sure that some photo essays will be coming your way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprinting.<\/strong> I didn&#8217;t make sprinting a priority in my workouts this year, so I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a failure. However, I do want to include more sprinting in my training next year. I made it to the track 3 or 4 times this year. Next year, I&#8217;d like to sprint once per week for a few months and see how my body responds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Making people wait on me.<\/strong> I know I do it too often, especially with family and friends.<\/p>\n<h2>3. What am I working toward?<\/h2>\n<p>So where is all of this going? What direction am I heading in? What am I hoping to build, to create, and to share with the world?<\/p>\n<p>After much thought, I think there are 5 central themes that drive my work, my relationships, and my life.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Rituals and habits.<\/strong> I believe in process. I believe that it&#8217;s more important to become the type of person that you want to become than it is to achieve a particular result. The system is more important than the goal. Furthermore, the science of habits is probably the central theme that ties all of my work together.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adventure and exploration.<\/strong> There is very little in life that is better than a good adventure. The world is meant to be experienced, not read about.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creativity and craftsmanship.<\/strong> There is a magic that comes from making things. I believe that it&#8217;s important to be a creator, not merely a consumer. I want to make sure that I not only share great ideas through my writing, but that I actually put them into practice as well. It&#8217;s better to live in the arena than to judge from the crowd.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Strength and confidence.<\/strong> I believe in living a physical life. It is through sport, competition, and physical pursuit that I have developed confidence in myself and I think that it is important to pursue those areas on a consistent basis. Pushing yourself physically reveals what you are made of mentally.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service and teamwork.<\/strong> I believe that we should be relentlessly helpful, teach everything we know, and serve whomever we can reach. Regardless of what projects I work on in the future, I hope they will serve others and focus on a cause that is bigger than myself. After working up the courage to write publicly, I now believe that writing is among the most important things I do because it allows me to help people on a larger scale.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve said many times this year that I\u2019m not an expert. I have plenty that I need to improve upon and with most of the areas above (even the good ones), I don\u2019t have it all figured out. I&#8217;m just sharing what I learn along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I am happy with the progress I made in 2013 and I\u2019m excited to make 2014 a year of slow gains, little habits, and unwavering consistency.<\/p>\n<p>As always, thanks for reading. And feel free to use my annual review as a template for your own.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-5406\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Thanks to <a title=\"Chris Guillebeau\" href=\"http:\/\/chrisguillebeau.com\/\">Chris Guillebeau<\/a> for inspiring me to write this Annual Review.<\/p><\/li><!--\/#footnote-1.footnote--><\/ol><\/div><!--\/#footnotes-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year I&#8217;m writing my first Annual Review, which will give me a chance to take stock of what went well and what could have gone better, while also giving me a moment to enjoy the progress I&#8217;ve made over the past 12 months.
