But more than any one work, it\u2019s his phrases that have made him famous. For example, here are some popular sayings that have been attributed to Heywood&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Out of sight out of mind.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Better late than never.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;The more the merrier.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Many hands make light work.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And there is one phrase from Heywood that is particularly interesting when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habits\">building better habits<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRome was not built in one day.\u201d<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Just Lay a Brick<\/h2>\n<p>Typically, people use the phrase \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day\u201d to remind someone of the time needed to create something great.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s true. It takes time \u2014 sometimes years \u2014 to master a skill, craft, or habit. And while it\u2019s good to keep perspective on your dreams, I think it\u2019s better to remember the other side of this story:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The problem is that it can be really easy to overestimate the importance of building your Roman empire and underestimate the importance of laying another brick.<\/p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s just another brick. Why worry about it? Much better to think about the dream of Rome. Right?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Actually Rome is just the result, the bricks are the system. <a title=\"goals and systems\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/goals-systems\">The system is greater than the goal<\/a>. Focusing on your habits is more important than worrying about your outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s nothing necessarily impressive about laying a brick. It\u2019s not a fantastic amount of work. It\u2019s not a grand feat of strength or stamina or intelligence. Nobody is going to applaud you for it.<\/p>\n<p>But laying a brick every day, year after year? That\u2019s how you build an empire.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a title=\"how to stop procrastinating\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/how-to-stop-procrastinating\">start small<\/a>. You can focus on <a title=\"marginal gains\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/marginal-gains\">improving 1 percent each day<\/a>. You can simply <a title=\"repetitions\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/repetitions\">put in another rep<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to build everything you want today, but you do have to find a way to lay another brick.<\/p>\n<p>If you want more practical ideas for how to build new habits (and break bad ones), check out my book\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/atomic-habits\"><em>Atomic<\/em> <em>Habits<\/em><\/a>, which will show you how small changes in habits can lead to remarkable results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>John Heywood was an English playwright who lived hundreds of years ago.
