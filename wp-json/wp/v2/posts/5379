Whether it&#8217;s sitting at a desk, in a car, or on the couch, the default position for many people is shoulders forward, hips flexed, back slightly bent, and hunched over.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the problem&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, this hunched over position leads to tightness, inflexibility, and poor posture. You&#8217;ll start to feel hip pain, back pain, tight muscles, and more.<\/p>\n<p>You need something to open your body back up, pull you into proper alignment, and help you stand up straight. After searching for a lot of alternatives, I have one simple exercise that will do the trick.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The Simple Mobility Cure<\/h2>\n<p>The exercise in the video below is taught by <a title=\"Max Shank\" href=\"http:\/\/maxshank.com\/\">Max Shank<\/a> and he says it is &#8220;arguably the best mobility exercise you can possibly do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After doing this for a few months, I would agree.<\/p>\n<p>The exercise is called the Thoracic Bridge and there are two reasons why it is awesome.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It keeps life simple.<\/strong> I know that my body would benefit from doing more mobility and flexibility work each day, but I also have dozens of responsibilities that are more of a priority in my life. I don&#8217;t want to constantly assess which joints need work and then memorize 30 different mobility exercises and decide which one to use. Instead, I would rather have one or two simple exercises that I can consistently implement to avoid most problems. The Thoracic Bridge keeps things simple while still providing big benefits.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It can be done in just 30 seconds without equipment.<\/strong> Add this mobility exercise into your work day and you&#8217;ll immediately feel the benefit in your hips, shoulders, and back. The first time I did it, I cracked my own back and immediately felt my posture improve. But what makes it particularly useful is that you don&#8217;t need any equipment or special gear. All you need is some open space and a willingness to get in a strange position for 30 seconds.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it&#8230;<br \/>\n<a name=\"video\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Thoracic Bridge Tutorial<\/h2>\n<div class=\"video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rm9L0RIhR3s?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you probably spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen.
