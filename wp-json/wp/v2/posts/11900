Whenever possible, I believe this is the best strategy because it forces you to direct your energy to the tasks of highest value.<\/p>\n<p>There is one common problem with this approach:<\/p>\n<p>After ranking your priorities for the day, if the number one task is a really big project then it can leave you feeling frustrated because it takes a long time to finish.<\/p>\n<p>For example, last week I was working on a project that took two days to complete. On Tuesday morning, when I began the task, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish it that day. Even though I knew I would work all day without completing the task, I still found myself feeling frustrated by mid-afternoon. It was 4 p.m. and I had spent all day working on the most important task, yet the only thing I had to show for my work was an unfinished project. My to-do list was just as long as it was in the morning, even though I was spending my time in the correct way.<\/p>\n<p>I was doing the right thing, but it can still be disheartening to be stuck on Task #1 when you&#8217;ve been working all day. These feelings of frustration are a possible downside of the prioritized to-do list.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Trollope, however, developed a solution to this common problem.<\/p>\n<h2>Tiny Milestones, More Momentum<\/h2>\n<p>Anthony Trollope was in the business of writing books and writing a book is a big project. It is not the type of task that you can complete in a day. In some cases, merely writing a chapter is too big a task for a single day.<\/p>\n<p>However, instead of measuring his progress based on the completion of chapters or books, Trollope measured his progress in 15-minute increments. This approach allowed him to enjoy feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment very quickly while continuing to work on the large task of writing a book.<\/p>\n<p>This is a big deal for two reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/physics-productivity\">Small measures of progress help to maintain momentum<\/a> over the long-run, which means you\u2019re more likely to finish large tasks.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/domino-effect\">The faster you complete a productive task, the more quickly your day develops an attitude of productivity and effectiveness<\/a>. <a href=\"#footnote-2-11900\" id=\"note-2-11900\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I have found this second point, the speed with which you complete your first task of the day, to be of particular importance for maintaining a high productive output day after day.<\/p>\n<h2>Speed to Completion<\/h2>\n<p>Anthony Trollope didn\u2019t have to wait three months to feel a sense of accomplishment from completing his book nor did he have to wait three days until he finished a chapter. Every fifteen minutes he could check his progress. If he wrote 250 words, he could mentally check that time block off his list and feel a sense of immediate accomplishment.<\/p>\n<p>Trollope&#8217;s 15-minute writing block was a well-designed progress meter that allowed Trollope to \u201cget to finished\u201d faster while still working on a big task. He received the long-term value of working on the most important things and the immediate payoff of finishing each little time block quickly.<\/p>\n<p>You can employ a similar strategy for tasks besides writing, of course. For example, rather than measuring his progress on a bigger task like monthly revenue, Trent Dyrsmid tracked each sales call he made <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/paper-clips\">with a paper clip<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The basic idea is to design a way to get rapid feedback while working on bigger projects. The faster we get feedback that we are moving in the right direction, the more likely we are to continue moving that way.<\/p>\n<p>Work for the long-term. Measure your progress for the short-term.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-11900\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Trollope was a disciplined writer in all respects.
