This is especially true of the major decisions that we make in life.<\/p>\n<p>For example&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Finding the right person to marry.<\/strong> Think of the first person you dated. Would this person have been the best choice for your life partner? Go even further back and imagine the first person you had a crush on.

Or 30 years old? Or even 25 years old? Consider how much you have learned about yourself since that time. There is a lot of change and growth that happens during life. There is no reason to believe that your life\u2019s work should be easily determined when you graduate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Starting a business.<\/strong> It is unlikely that your first business idea will be your best one.

I have made many mistakes and I have discovered five major lessons from my experiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Choices that seem poor in hindsight are an indication of growth, not self-worth or intelligence.<\/strong> When you look back on your choices from a year ago, you should always hope to find a few decisions that seem stupid now because that means you are growing. If you only live in the safety zone where you know you can\u2019t mess up, then you\u2019ll never unleash your true potential. If you know enough about something to make the optimal decision on the first try, then you\u2019re not challenging yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Given that your first choice is likely to be wrong, the best thing you can do is get started.<\/strong> The faster you learn from being wrong, the sooner you can discover what is right. For complex situations like relationships or entrepreneurship, you literally have to <a title=\"Successful people start before they feel ready.\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/successful-people-start-before-they-feel-ready\">start before you feel ready<\/a> because it\u2019s not possible for anyone to be truly ready. The best way to learn is to <a title=\"Learning vs. practicing.\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/learning-vs-practicing\">start practicing<\/a>. <a href=\"#footnote-1-8710\" id=\"note-1-8710\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Break down topics that are too big to master into smaller tasks that can be mastered.<\/strong> I can&#8217;t look at any business and tell you what to do. Entrepreneurship is too big of a topic. But, I can look at any website and tell you how to optimize it for building an email list because that topic is small enough for me to develop some level of expertise. If you want to get better at making accurate first choices, then play in a smaller arena. As Niels Bohr, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, famously said, &#8220;An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. The time to trust your gut is when you have the knowledge or experience to back it up.<\/strong> You can trust yourself to make sharp decisions in areas where you already have proven expertise. For everything else, the only way to discover what works is to adopt a philosophy of experimentation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. The fact that failure will happen is not an excuse for expecting to fail.<\/strong> There is no reason to be depressed or give up simply because you will make a few wrong choices. Even more crucial, you must try your best every time because it is the effort and the practice that drives the learning process. They are essential, even if you fail. Realize that no single choice is destined to fail, but that occasional failure is <a title=\"Fail like a scientist.\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/failure-scientist\">the cost you have to pay if you want to be right<\/a>. Expect to win and play like it from the outset.<\/p>\n<p>Your first choice is rarely the optimal choice. Make it now, <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/quality-comparison\">stop judging yourself<\/a>, and start growing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-8710\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I believe that this is also one of the reasons why history repeats itself. There are many situations that simply have to be experienced to be understood. Even if you read the opinion of every expert in a field, the only way to make progress in your own life is to experiment. Of course, not all experiments go to plan and, as a result, the same mistakes are made over and over again as each person goes through the process of finding their own way.<\/p><\/li><!--\/#footnote-1.footnote--><\/ol><\/div><!--\/#footnotes-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a rule, we are incredibly hard on ourselves when it comes to being wrong and making big decisions in life.
