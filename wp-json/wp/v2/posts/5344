Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you\u2019re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16300 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Forget about setting goals, focus on your systems instead. \" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals-140x93.jpg 140w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals-960x640.jpg 960w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/systems-vs-goals.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now for the interesting question: if you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results?<\/p>\n<p>I think you would.<\/p>\n<p>The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, \u201cThe score takes care of itself.\u201d The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.<\/p>\n<p>What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.<\/p>\n<h2>Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.<\/h2>\n<p>Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning\u2014the survivors\u2014and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn\u2019t succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn\u2019t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British Cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before\u2014just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.<\/p>\n<h2>Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.<\/h2>\n<p>Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room\u2014for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you\u2019ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You\u2019re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.<\/p>\n<p>Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That\u2019s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.<\/p>\n<h2>Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.<\/h2>\n<p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: \u201cOnce I reach my goal, then I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you\u2019re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I\u2019ve slipped into this trap so many times I\u2019ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, goals create an \u201ceither-or\u201d conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.<\/p>\n<p>A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don\u2019t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.<\/p>\n<h2>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a \u201cyo-yo\u201d effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It\u2019s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.<\/p>\n<h2>Fall In Love With Systems<\/h2>\n<p>None of this is to say that goals are useless. However, I&#8217;ve found that goals are good for <em>planning<\/em> your progress and systems are good for actually <em>making<\/em> progress.<\/p>\n<p>Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference.<a href=\"#footnote-1-5344\" id=\"note-1-5344\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>This article is an excerpt from Chapter 1 of my New York Times bestselling book\u00a0<\/em><em>Atomic<\/em>\u00a0<em>Habits.\u00a0<a title=\"Read more here\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/atomic-habits\">Read more here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-5344\" class=\"footnote\"><p><strong>Thanks<\/strong> to Scott Adams for <a title=\"Scott Adams\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/scott-adams8217-secret-of-success-failure-1381639163\">his Wall Street Journal article<\/a>, which helped prompt this piece.<\/p><\/li><!--\/#footnote-1.footnote--><\/ol><\/div><!--\/#footnotes-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article is an excerpt from Atomic Habits, my New York Times bestselling book.
