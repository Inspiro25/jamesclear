As regular readers know, simplicity matches up well with <a title=\"exercise philosophy\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/best-exercises-basics\">my exercise philosophy<\/a>. (Dan John also has two first names. And you should always fear a man with two first names.)<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I recently heard Dan John say,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I often tell my new athletes: &#8220;Sorry, you just are not good enough to be disappointed.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, in the beginning you need to <a title=\"overcoming fear\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/overcoming-fear\">get comfortable with feeling stupid, uncertain, and unskilled<\/a>. You&#8217;re not allowed to be disappointed by your amateur performance because you haven&#8217;t developed the skills of a professional yet. It&#8217;s only the professionals that are allowed to be disappointed because they have put in the work to be better.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"chosen ones\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/chosen-ones\">J.K Rowling<\/a> is allowed to be disappointed if she writes a bad book because she put in 20 years of work to get good.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"deliberate practice\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/deliberate-practice\">Kobe Bryant<\/a> is allowed to be disappointed if he plays a bad game because he put in 20 years of work to become amazing.<\/li>\n<li>When he was alive, <a title=\"jack lalanne\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/superhumans-jack-lalanne\">Jack LaLanne<\/a> was allowed to be disappointed with a bad workout because he trained for 60 years to stay fit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But you and me? We&#8217;re not good enough to be disappointed yet. We&#8217;re bad enough to get to work.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Bad Enough to Get to Work<\/h2>\n<p>In the beginning, you\u2019re still learning. You\u2019re still developing. You\u2019re still building. You haven\u2019t developed enough competency to feel disappointed by your performance. You\u2019re supposed to feel stupid and unskilled.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easy to forget to give yourself some slack when you&#8217;re starting a journey that is important to you. Usually, the people who have the least right to feel disappointed are the ones who get down on themselves the most.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We feel disappointed when we start a new job and don\u2019t do it as well as we would like.<\/li>\n<li>We feel disappointed when we set fitness goals for ourselves and don&#8217;t reach them.<\/li>\n<li>We feel disappointed when we finally work up the courage to start our first business and it fails.<\/li>\n<li>We feel disappointed when we write our first book and nobody reads it.<\/li>\n<li>We feel disappointed when we pitch someone on our great idea and they don&#8217;t care.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But the start is supposed to be a struggle. In fact, it&#8217;s all supposed to be a struggle. The approach of professionals is an indication of just how strongly struggle is linked to success.
