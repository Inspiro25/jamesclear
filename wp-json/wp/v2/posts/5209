I like to keep things simple. I&#8217;d prefer to abandon the details, understand the main idea, and actually make adjustments.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have all the answers, of course, but here&#8217;s what is working for me right now and how you can use these ideas to eat healthy, lose weight, and gain muscle.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>How to Buy Healthy Food Without Thinking<\/h2>\n<p>The main idea of most good diets is the same: eat whole foods that are unprocessed and that grew or lived outdoors. Some of them have different variations \u2014 no animal products, no grains, etc. \u2014 but most of them fit the general &#8220;real food&#8221; mold.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that \u2014 if you\u2019re anything like me \u2014 you will eat whatever is close to you, whether it came from Mother Nature or not. As a result, the best strategy is to surround yourself with healthy food.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I do it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>When I go to the grocery store, I only walk around the &#8220;outer ring\u201d of the store. I don\u2019t walk down the aisles. The outer ring is where the healthy food usually lives: fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, eggs, and nuts. These are items that grew or lived outdoors. That\u2019s what I eat.<\/p>\n<p>The aisles are where all of the boxed and processed stuff is placed. Don\u2019t go down those aisles and you won\u2019t buy those foods. Don\u2019t buy those foods and they won\u2019t be around for you to eat.<\/p>\n<p>Try this the next time you go to the store and do your best to not to make exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, there will be the occasional time that you&#8217;ll need to go down an aisle to pick up spices or grab a bottle of olive oil, but this is rare. The last three times I\u2019ve been at the grocery store, I have easily stayed on the &#8220;outer ring&#8221; and I bet you can do the same.<\/p>\n<p>I know that I will eat everything around me, so I do my best to surround myself with good things. This is another way that I design my environment for success, which is a strategy that I wrote about in detail here: <a title=\"environment design\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/environment-design-organ-donation\">Environment Design<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Eat Less Without Thinking<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of people want to lose weight, burn fat, and build a lean body. Maybe you do too.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, the simplest way to do this is to buy healthier foods and eat less overall. If you combine these two strategies with consistency and exercise, then the rest usually takes care of itself. I already covered my simple approach to buying healthier food, so here are the two best strategies I\u2019ve discovered for eating less.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important Note:<\/strong> as with most diet ideas, these strategies should be used in moderation. There is a tremendous amount of social, cultural, and peer pressure in our world to &#8220;be thin.&#8221; The strategies I&#8217;m sharing below aren&#8217;t meant to promote that type of behavior. My goal is offer ideas that make it easier to live healthy in a sustainable way. Your ultimate goal should always be to regain your health and love yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Use smaller plates, bowls, pans, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make less and serve less, and then you will eat less. These strategies work much better than relying on willpower or counting calories.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple research studies have shown that you will always fill your plate to the brim and eat it clean. Given that, if you want to eat less, the best way to do so is to use smaller plates.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re at it, making the switch to dark green plates might be a good idea as well because it will increase the amount of green vegetables that you eat.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote about the science behind smaller plates and green plates in <a title=\"smaller plates\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/feeling-fat\">this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Eat fewer, but bigger, meals (i.e. switch to intermittent fasting)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting\">Intermittent fasting<\/a> is an eating schedule where you eat two bigger meals during an 8\u2013hour span instead of three or four smaller meals throughout the day. Then, you fast for the other 16 hours of the day.<\/p>\n<p>I have been practicing intermittent fasting for over 2 years (<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/good-bad-intermittent-fasting\">here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned<\/a>). My first meal is usually around 12pm and my last meal is usually around 8pm.<\/p>\n<p>In theory, you could eat the same amount of food during two meals as you could during three. (In fact, I\u2019m trying to gain muscle right now, so I\u2019m trying to eat way more during my 8\u2013hour feeding window.)<\/p>\n<p>In practice, however, most people end up eating less when they switch from three meals to two meals. There is a certain amount of food that you consider to be a &#8220;meal&#8221; and you tend to eat that same amount whether you have two meals per day or three meals per day. The end result is that you eat less without thinking about it.<\/p>\n<h2>What You Eat Is More Important Than When You Eat<\/h2>\n<p>Intermittent fasting tends to help you burn fat and retain muscle. It also makes your life easier because you have one less meal to cook and clean. Those are my reasons for practicing intermittent fasting.<\/p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to realize that <strong>what you eat will always be more important than when you eat.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Intermittent fasting works best when combined with a healthy diet. You can&#8217;t pound Doritos from 12pm to 8pm and think that those extra pounds will magically fall away. Intermittent fasting is simply another weapon to use in the blubbery battle against fat \u2014 just like smaller plates and the &#8220;outer ring&#8221; strategy are weapons at your disposal.<\/p>\n<p>If you want more information, I\u2019ve written about intermittent fasting in great detail in these articles:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a title=\"intermittent fasting\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting\">The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Intermittent Fasting<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"intermittent fasting\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/intermittent-fasting-lessons-learned\">12 Lessons Learned from 1 Year of Intermittent Fasting<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"intermittent fasting\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/reader-mailbag-intermittent-fasting\">Reader Mailbag: Answers to the Most Common Intermittent Fasting Questions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"morning routine\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/25000-mornings\">25,000 Mornings: 8 Ways to Improve Your Morning Routine<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>How to Eat Whatever You Want Without Feeling Guilty<\/h2>\n<p>I think life is meant to be lived joyfully. I have no desire to judge myself for eating pizza or to feel guilty for drinking a beer.<\/p>\n<p>But, I also know that I feel much better when I eat healthy. Plus, I love the idea of maximizing my potential and turning my body into an athletic machine.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I balance the two&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I start by making sure that it&#8217;s easy for me to make the right choice, most of the time. The &#8220;outer ring&#8221; shopping strategy helps to make that possible and as a result, I eat whole foods 80% of the time.<\/p>\n<p>Because I know that I&#8217;m already making good choices most of the time, I don&#8217;t worry about eating a soft pretzel at the ballpark or going out to get pizza with friends.<\/p>\n<p>I also have a simple rule that I try to follow: <strong>whenever I eat an unhealthy meal, I follow it with a healthy one.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Top performers <a title=\"get back on track\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/get-back-on-track\">get back on track<\/a> faster than most people, and that&#8217;s what I try to do with my diet. I don&#8217;t worry about having fun and I try to enjoy life, but I also use this simple rule to guide me back toward a healthy diet as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid the Hype and Make Simple Changes<\/h2>\n<p>I like simple rules.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don\u2019t follow a diet plan. Instead, I shop on the outer ring of the store and buy foods that come from outdoors.<\/li>\n<li>I don\u2019t count calories. Instead, I let my intermittent fasting schedule regulate my eating.<\/li>\n<li>I don\u2019t judge myself when I eat something unhealthy. Instead, I try to follow it with a healthy meal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a result of these simple strategies I&#8217;ve been able to eat healthier without much effort or thought.<\/p>\n<p>And most importantly, I&#8217;ve actually made improvements instead of getting bogged down in the details of a particular diet. When it comes to diets and nutrition, I think you are better off moving in the right direction rather than searching for the perfect direction.<\/p>\n<p>Less effort, better food, and more time for what matters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I want to live a healthy life in the most effortless way possible.
