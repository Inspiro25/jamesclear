I cited research studies, looked up video clips from some of the world&#8217;s most prominent thought leaders, and edited for 2 hours. In the end, I was totally underwhelmed by the result.<\/p>\n<p>Creating something valuable is hard.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re building a business, creating art, or forming a relationship. There are bound to be days when your best effort turns out to be mediocre. It&#8217;s easy to feel like you&#8217;re wasting your time. And if you&#8217;re working on something really important to you, then it&#8217;s easy to let one wasted effort spoil the rest of your day.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how I felt about 30 minutes ago.<\/p>\n<p>The article I wrote was disjointed and tried to cover too much ground without getting to a tangible action point that you could actually use in your life. (Giving you something to act on to live a healthier life is my primary goal whenever writing an article.)<\/p>\n<p>To make an example of myself, I decide to leave the article up. If you&#8217;re interested, you can <a title=\"unreasonable expectations\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/unreasonable-expectations\">read it here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, I decided to stop staring at the screen and do my pushup workout for the day. (I&#8217;m working toward doing 100 pushups in row. Once I do it, I&#8217;ll share my whole program and lessons learned with you.)<\/p>\n<h2>What Happened?<\/h2>\n<p>Instead of letting my poor writing ruin my workout mentality, I decided to get excited about the workout, focus on the task at hand, and I ended up setting a new personal record for pushups in a single workout.<\/p>\n<p>The personal record is great, but the lessons that are underneath it are much more important. In fact, these lessons tie directly into 3 of the core beliefs that our community has&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Health and happiness is the foundation of living a remarkable life.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fitness has saved my day more than once. There&#8217;s something about physical movement that centers the mind.<\/p>\n<p>Think about the highest performing people from any field in life. How many of them are severely unhealthy and out of shape? Very few.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling with something mentally, then get out and move physically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Live in the arena instead of judging from the crowd.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you play the game, then there will be days when you get your ass handed to you. You&#8217;ll produce average work, you&#8217;ll make stupid decisions, you&#8217;ll get beat by someone who is smarter, faster, or better.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the cost of admission. That&#8217;s the price of being in the thick of things instead of watching from the sideline.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s better to work on things that are important to you and feel the frustration of failure than to play it safe and never push yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Move toward the next thing, not away from the last thing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Struggling with your latest project? Go have a good workout.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to get your business off the ground? Grab lunch with a good friend.<\/p>\n<p>Confused about what your boss wants from you? Make a tasty meal for dinner.<\/p>\n<p>If something isn&#8217;t going well, then don&#8217;t run from it. Find something else to get excited about instead. Spend as much time as you can doing things that pull you in rather than pushing frustration away.<\/p>\n<p>Move toward the next thing, not away from the last thing. It&#8217;s a subtle shift that makes all the difference in the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever let one bad experience ruin the rest of your day?
