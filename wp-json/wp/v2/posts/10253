The team started the 1985\u20131986 NBA season with an astounding 29\u20135 record. \u201cThe pundits were saying that we might be the best team in the history of basketball,\u201d head coach Pat Riley said after the season.<a href=\"#footnote-1-10253\" id=\"note-1-10253\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a> Surprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986 playoffs and suffered a season-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals. The \u201cbest team in the history of basketball\u201d didn\u2019t even play for the NBA championship.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn\u2019t want to see flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or CBE.<a href=\"#footnote-2-10253\" id=\"note-2-10253\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10316 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/pat-riley-lakers.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Riley, Los Angeles Lakers head coach, devised a plan to get 1% better. \" width=\"700\" height=\"558\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Taking Their Number<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cWhen players first join the Lakers,&#8221; Riley explained, &#8220;we track their basketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking Their Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain and then improve upon his averages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that Riley was interested in the <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/average-speed\">average speed<\/a> of his players. His first calculation was to see what a player&#8217;s normal day looked like, not his best day.<\/p>\n<p>After determining a player\u2019s baseline level of performance, Riley added a key step. He asked each player to \u201cimprove their output by at least 1 percent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-3-10253\" id=\"note-3-10253\" rel=\"footnote\">3<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or statistics but about giving your \u201cbest effort spiritually and mentally and physically.\u201d Players got credit for \u201callowing an opponent to run into you when you know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls, going after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a teammate when the player he\u2019s guarding has surged past him, and other \u2018unsung hero\u2019 deeds.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Calculating Your Career Best Effort<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know Riley&#8217;s exact formula, but here&#8217;s what the CBE calculation might look like in practice:<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">As an example, let\u2019s say that Magic Johnson\u2014the Lakers star player at the time\u2014had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game. Magic also got credit for an \u201cunsung hero\u201d deed by diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game.<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we subtract the 5 turnovers (34 \u2013 5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33 minutes played.<\/p>\n<p class=\"06Extract1P\">29\/33 = 0.879<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">Magic\u2019s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated for all of a player\u2019s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was asked to improve by 1 percent over the season.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 3: Historical Comparisons<\/h2>\n<p>Riley compared each player\u2019s current CBE to not only their past performances but also those of other players in the league. As Riley put it, \u201cWe rank team members alongside league opponents who play the same position and have similar role definitions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, \u201cRiley trumpeted the top performers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and measured them against the corresponding players on his own roster. Solid, reliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, \u201cWe stacked the month of November, 1986, next to November, 1985, and showed the players whether they were doing better or worse than at the same point last season. Then we showed them how their performance figures for December, 1986, stacked up against November\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Imagine you&#8217;re one of the players. Every week you walk into the locker room and see your name ranked alongside Michael Jordan or Larry Bird or some other competitor across the league. You&#8217;re constantly aware of how you are performing relative to the competition and relative to your average performance. It is impossible to lie to yourself about whether you are playing well or poorly. You are are constantly aware of your choices, your actions, and your performance.<\/p>\n<p>Compare that situation to how most of us live our lives. We don&#8217;t track or <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/measuring\">measure the things that we say are important to us<\/a>. We make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves about our daily performance. We have no evidence of whether we are performing better or worse compared to previous months or years. It&#8217;s not hard to see why the Career Best Effort program delivered results.<\/p>\n<h2>The Results of Career Best Effort<\/h2>\n<p>The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they were NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to another title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, \u201cSustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-4-10253\" id=\"note-4-10253\" rel=\"footnote\">4<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What Makes Great Performers Great?<\/h2>\n<p>There is a surprisingly narrow gap that separates the good performance from the great performance.
