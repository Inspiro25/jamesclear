I did this for more than a year. There were a variety of reasons and excuses that I used to rationalize why I wasn\u2019t sharing my writing with others, but in many ways it boiled down to fear.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t realize at the time: fear isn\u2019t something that must be avoided. It is not an indicator that you\u2019re doing things wrong. Fear is simply a cost that all artists have to pay on the way to doing meaningful work.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, not everything that is thought or written or created needs to be shared. In our age, where everyone has a voice and a platform, there is a lot of noise created.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you have a story inside of you, I think you should share it. If you have an idea that you\u2019d like to create, I think you should build it. If you have a dream that would make the world a slightly better place, then I think it\u2019s your responsibility to deliver it to the rest of us. But it won\u2019t be easy. All artists deal with fears, self-doubts, questions, and a roller coaster ride of emotions.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are six passages from famous authors, actors, and artists on how to overcome fear and unleash your creativity.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Fear Tells Us What We Have to Do<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7030 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/steven-pressfield.jpg\" alt=\"steven pressfield on how to overcome fear\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;Are you paralyzed with fear? That\u2019s a good sign. Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do. Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Resistance is experienced as fear; the degree of fear equates the strength of Resistance. Therefore, the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u2013<\/em>Steven Pressfield, <a title=\"The War of Art by Steven Pressfield\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/the-war-of-art\">The War of Art<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, it is <a title=\"start first\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/start-succeed\">more important to start than it is to succeed<\/a>. It is only through starting that we reveal the opportunity for growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Start Small<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7031 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/seth-godin.jpg\" alt=\"seth godin on how to overcome fear\" width=\"700\" height=\"644\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;What we need to do is say, &#8220;What\u2019s the smallest, tiniest thing that I can master and what\u2019s the scariest thing I can do in front of the smallest number of people that can teach me how to dance with the fear?&#8221; Once we get good at that, we just realize that it\u2019s not fatal. And it\u2019s not intellectually realize \u2013 we\u2019ve lived something that wasn\u2019t fatal. And that idea is what\u2019s so key \u2014 because then you can do it a little bit more.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u2013<\/em>Seth Godin (<a title=\"Seth Godin interview\" href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/brainpicker\/seth-godin-in-conversation-with-debbie-millman\">full interview<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"mental toughness\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/mental-toughness\">Mental toughness<\/a> is a skill and like any skill it can be developed. Learning how to overcome fear is just like <a title=\"Transform Your Habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habits\">building a new habit<\/a>. Start small and increase slowly.<\/p>\n<h2>Run to the Roar<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7032 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/tina-essmaker.jpg\" alt=\"tina essmaker on how to overcome fear\" width=\"700\" height=\"646\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;When you are thinking about doing something and it feels scary, when it feels like this big lion is waiting at the finish line and he\u2019s roaring and he\u2019s ferocious and he\u2019s going to tear you apart&#8230; you should just run toward that lion anyway. Run to the roar.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u2013Tina Essmaker (<a title=\"Tina Essmaker Design Matters interview\" href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/designmatters\/essmaker\">full interview<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"comparison\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/quality-comparison\">It\u2019s not your job to tell yourself no<\/a>. It\u2019s not your job to reject yourself or grade yourself or debate the value or worthiness of your ideas. Your job is to create. Your job is to share. Your job is to overcome fear and run the race.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, if you build something people might judge it or dislike it. But if you don\u2019t create and share the things that you have inside of you, then you\u2019ll commit the far worse crime of rejecting yourself. You can either be judged because you created something or ignored because you left your greatness inside of you.<\/p>\n<h2>Now is as Good a Time as Any<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7033 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/hugh-laurie.jpg\" alt=\"hugh laurie on how to overcome fear\" width=\"700\" height=\"438\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible thing, I think, in life to wait until you&#8217;re ready.

I mean, I say that confidently as if I&#8217;m about to go bungee jumping or something \u2014 I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m not a crazed risk taker.
