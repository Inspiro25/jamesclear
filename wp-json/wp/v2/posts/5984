To solve this problem and break things down in a very simple manner, I have created this strategy guide for how to build new habits that actually stick.<\/p>\n<p>Even more detailed information is available in my book, <a title=\"Transform Your Habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/atomic-habits\">Atomic Habits<\/a>.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>1.

Research shows that <a title=\"willpower decision fatigue\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/willpower-decision-fatigue\">willpower is like a muscle<\/a>. It gets fatigued as you use it throughout the day. Another way to think of this is that your motivation ebbs and flows. It rises and falls. Stanford professor BJ Fogg calls this the &#8220;<a title=\"BJ Fogg motivation wave\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fqUSjHjIEFg\">motivation wave<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Solve this problem by picking a new habit that is easy enough that you don&#8217;t need motivation to do it. Rather than starting with 50 pushups per day, start with 5 pushups per day. Rather than trying to meditate for 10 minutes per day, start by meditating for one minute per day. Make it easy enough that you can get it done without motivation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Further reading:<\/strong> <a title=\"Identity-based habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/identity-based-habits\">Identity-Based Habits: How to Actually Stick to Your Goals<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2.

Take some time to consider what will prevent your habit from happening. What are some things that are likely to get in your way? What are some daily emergencies that are likely to pull you off course? How can you plan to work around these issues? Or, at least, how you can bounce back quickly from them and get back on track?<\/p>\n<p>You just need to be consistent, not perfect.
