Although you should highlight your victories, it&#8217;s not about comparing yourself to others or picking a winner.

What went well this year?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Writing.<\/strong> As regular readers know, I publish new articles every Monday and Thursday. I&#8217;m proud to say that I stuck to this schedule without missing a post in 2014. (I did take some time off during a <a title=\"James Clear sabbatical june 2014\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/sabbatical-june-2014\">planned sabbatical<\/a> in June.)<\/p>\n<p>The consistency paid off. jamesclear.vercel.app had more than 2.4 million visitors in 2014. (Thank you for reading!) In total, there are now 111,964 email subscribers who receive <a title=\"James Clear weekly newsletter\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/newsletter\">the free weekly newsletter<\/a>. With over 100,000 email subscribers in just two years, I believe jamesclear.vercel.app is the fastest-growing single-author blog in the world. <a href=\"#footnote-1-6346\" id=\"note-1-6346\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Writing highlights for 2014:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>88 new articles published (<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/articles\">browse my best articles<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>70,839 new email subscribers (111,964 total)<\/li>\n<li>2,485,951 unique visitors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Travel.<\/strong> I visited 7 countries and 14 states in 2014. These numbers are similar to last year, which means that international travel is becoming a normal part of my life. Honestly, this is pretty hard to believe. Just four years ago, I had never been outside of North America. As of 2014, I have been to 23 countries in total. That said, I still love family vacations to Kentucky state parks.<\/p>\n<p>Travel highlights for 2014:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 countries (4 new): Canada, Denmark, England (twice), Morocco, Scotland, Spain, United States.<\/li>\n<li>14 states (2 new): California (twice), Colorado, Florida (twice), Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas (twice), Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Strength Training.<\/strong> <a title=\"consistency\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/stay-focused\">Consistency is everything<\/a> when it comes to strength training. My goal is to be the type of person who doesn&#8217;t miss workouts (<a title=\"identity based habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/identity-based-habits\">more here<\/a>), and I did a good job of that this year. Overall, I did 113 strength training workouts in 2014. This is an average of 9.4 per month. Next year, I&#8217;d like to increase this to 120 total workouts (an average of 10 per month).<\/p>\n<p>Workouts per month in 2014:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>January &#8211; 7<\/li>\n<li>February &#8211; 7<\/li>\n<li>March &#8211; 10<\/li>\n<li>April &#8211; 12<\/li>\n<li>May &#8211; 6<\/li>\n<li>June &#8211; 10<\/li>\n<li>July &#8211; 9<\/li>\n<li>August &#8211; 12<\/li>\n<li>September &#8211; 9<\/li>\n<li>October &#8211; 13<\/li>\n<li>November &#8211; 6<\/li>\n<li>December &#8211; 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My best lifts of 2014:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean &#8211; 275 lbs (124 kg) for 1 rep<\/li>\n<li>Back Squat &#8211; 405 lbs (183 kg) for 1 rep<\/li>\n<li>Bench Press &#8211; 220 lbs (100 kg) for 5 sets of 5 reps<\/li>\n<li>Deadlift &#8211; 455 lbs (206 kg) for 2 reps<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Speaking.<\/strong> I was fortunate to speak at a variety of events this year in Long Beach, Dallas, Miami, London (twice), Statesboro, and Raleigh. I even had the chance to speak at the Google Campus in London. That said, I still haven&#8217;t decided how big of a role I want speaking to play in my business. (I don&#8217;t really want to be on the road speaking at 50 different events per year.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simplifying my business life.<\/strong> Focus is a trademark of the world&#8217;s greatest entrepreneurs (see <a title=\"Warren Buffett's focus strategy\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/buffett-focus\">Warren Buffett<\/a>). I still have plenty of progress to make in this area, but I did take a step forward this year. I closed two old business projects that were underperforming. I cancelled three software services that I was paying for, but rarely used. I also switched my email marketing service (from Aweber to <a title=\"Drip Email Marketing\" href=\"http:\/\/mbsy.co\/7NNwS\">Drip<\/a>) and my website hosting provider, which saved over $1,000 per month in expenses. Perhaps the biggest improvement: I became better at saying no and turned down multiple offers to partner with people on new businesses or otherwise spread myself too thin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Giving the credit to others.<\/strong> During my sabbatical in June, I thought about <a title=\"sabbatical improvements\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/sabbatical-improvements\">how I could improve my writing<\/a> and give more credit to the people who inspire me and influence my work. My first improvement was citing sources at the end of my articles. I also made an effort to verbally cite sources in interviews (I usually do 3 to 5 interviews per week). My favorite improvement, though, was creating my <a title=\"Thank You\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/thanks\">Thank You page<\/a>. This page is a small tribute to the people who have helped me throughout my life.<\/p>\n<h2>2. What didn\u2019t go so well this year?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Working on my weaknesses.<\/strong> Below, I have listed four major areas that I struggled with this year. The surprising thing? These four were also on my list last year. There are two interesting things I noticed. First, although I struggled in the same areas it was often for different reasons. Second, this could mean I am really staying focused on a few core areas (good) or that I am stumbling around and not focusing enough on the things I say are important to me (bad). I still haven&#8217;t figured out which one it is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creating products.<\/strong> Sigh. This was a failure no matter how you slice it. While I did launch two workshops and a larger course this year, I didn&#8217;t have the customer support systems in place to respond to issues quickly. I learned a lot, but I still feel bad that customers had to wait for the answers they needed. I also failed to complete the most important project: writing my book. I&#8217;ve written about <a title=\"big project syndrome\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/big-project-syndrome\">big project syndrome<\/a> before and I struggled with it again this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Doing travel photography work.<\/strong> File this one under the started-strong-but-limped-across-the-finish-line category. I began the year by doing a two-week photography trip to <a title=\"Morocco photos by James Clear\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/photography\/morocco\">Morocco<\/a>. It was incredible. A few months later, I took photos in <a title=\"Colorado photos by James Clear\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/photography\/colorado\">Rocky Mountain National Park<\/a>. During the second half of the year, however, I tried to cram photography work into trips with family and friends, which rarely worked out well. Next year, I would love to blend the storytelling of my photos with my weekly articles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprinting.<\/strong> This is one of those areas that I know I need to work on, but for some reason I just don&#8217;t do it. I know my hamstrings are a weak point when it comes to strength and that I need more cardio work. And yet, I barely did a sprint workout in 2014. Even though I write about building habits that stick, I have often said that I don&#8217;t have perfect habits myself. My lack of sprinting is another reminder that behavior change is hard and we&#8217;re all in this together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Making people wait on me.<\/strong> I&#8217;m always trying to fit too many tasks into too little time. The result? I end up making the people who love me the most wait on me.<\/p>\n<h2>3. What am I working toward?<\/h2>\n<p>My attention will be focused on two areas in 2015.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Going pro as a writer.<\/strong> I&#8217;ve been a full-time entrepreneur for four years now. I&#8217;ve started four different businesses (two of which succeeded) and a number of smaller projects. Someday I&#8217;ll share the full story. But more than anything I&#8217;ve done, I love writing my articles each week and helping people build habits that stick. So, it&#8217;s time to phase out other projects and turn pro. Mostly, that means finishing my first book. And 2015 is the year to do it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unifying our community.<\/strong> We have over 100,000 people receiving the free newsletter each week. Millions more read these articles each year. This is no longer a random collection of people on the web. We are a community now, and every community has a worldview that unites its members. After much thought, I believe that our worldview is built around 3 core principles and 3 daily actions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Core Principles:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Self-Respect: Authenticity, Balance, Happiness<\/li>\n<li>Resiliency: Preparedness, Strength, Sisu<\/li>\n<li>Growth: Learning, Adventure, Taking Action<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Daily Actions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Habits: Am I doing the right things consistently?<\/li>\n<li>Creativity: Am I contributing to the world or just consuming it?<\/li>\n<li>Service: Am I taking actions that make the lives of others better?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I can&#8217;t predict the future, but I can tell you that no matter where our community goes, these principles will be part of the journey.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n<p>I have said many times this year that I am not an expert. In most of the areas above (even the good ones), I don\u2019t have it all figured out. I\u2019m just sharing what I learn along the way.<\/p>\n<p>As always, it is a privilege to write for you.
