And then, without any planning at all, I found myself inside two different studios over the span of three days. Strange how life works like that.<\/p>\n<p>I assumed that I would see some nicely colored works windows or something similar, but that would be it. Little did I know, I was about to learn a lesson about life.<\/p>\n<p>During a conversation with one of the artists, I was told about a strategy they use to cut glass and immediately realized that this same idea applies to habits, improvement, and almost everything in life.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the artist told me&#8230;<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned from Stained Glass<\/h2>\n<p>Stained glass artists create different designs by making cuts on the glass to \u201cscore\u201d it and then breaking off the pattern or shape that they want to use in the finished product. (In other words, they make a notch in the glass and then break the pieces apart like you would with a Kit Kat bar.)<\/p>\n<p>The most difficult cut in stained glass is called an inside cut. Basically, it\u2019s a curved line where you throw away the part inside of the curve. The problem with inside cuts is that the edges of the curve tend to chip when the pieces of scored glass are broken apart. The image below shows what I mean.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5782\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut.jpg\" alt=\"stained glass inside cut\" width=\"700\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut.jpg 990w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-454x276.jpg 454w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-768x465.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-300x181.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As the artist talked about inside cuts, he said, &#8220;The glass will shatter if you try to cut too much off at once. The best way to do an inside cut is to slice off smaller curves piece-by-piece. In fact, it&#8217;s not just the best way to do it, it&#8217;s the only way to do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, you start by slicing a shallow curve and breaking a small piece off. Then you cut a slightly deeper curve and break that off. And so on, until you have your full inside cut. The image below shows the strategy.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5783\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-success.jpg\" alt=\"stained glass inside cut\" width=\"700\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-success.jpg 990w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-success-454x276.jpg 454w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-success-768x465.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/stained-glass-inside-cut-success-300x181.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By slowly cutting deeper and deeper curves, the artist prevents the glass from chipping and breaking as it changes shape.<\/p>\n<h2>Inside Cuts in Everyday Life<\/h2>\n<p>Changing your behavior, building new habits, and learning new skills is a lot like making an inside cut on a piece of glass.<\/p>\n<p>If you want, you can try to make a big change and cut the entire piece at once. We convince ourselves that we can do this all the time. We&#8217;ll commit to transforming our diet overnight or we get inspired to launch a business in a weekend or we finally get motivated to workout and push ourselves to the brink of exhaustion.<\/p>\n<p>If our life is like the piece of glass, we try to change the entire shape of it all at once.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because it&#8217;s so easy to <a title=\"slow gains\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/slow-gains\">focus on achievements instead of progress<\/a>. We tend to get obsessed with our goals rather than <a title=\"goals and systems\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/goals-systems\">focusing on our system<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve made this mistake tons of times myself. I&#8217;ll get excited and motivated and jump into a project or chase a goal with everything I have, but pretty soon the pieces begin to break and I have to start over.<\/p>\n<h2>Approach Change Like a Stained Glass Artist<\/h2>\n<p>The alternative is to approach your goals and dreams like a stained glass artist.<\/p>\n<p>You can choose to make slow, methodical gains. Start with a small, unimpressive cut \u2014 something you can easily handle \u2014 and do it well. Then, repeat with a slightly bigger step. And again. And again. And again.<\/p>\n<p>This process is like starting with something that is <a title=\"how to stop procrastinating\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/how-to-stop-procrastinating\">so easy that you can&#8217;t say no<\/a>. And then focusing on <a title=\"marginal gains\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/marginal-gains\">improving by one percent each time<\/a>. And then committing to <a title=\"repetitions\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/repetitions\">doing more repetitions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, change isn&#8217;t easy \u2014 no matter how you do it. Slow gains are boring. They&#8217;re unsexy. Nobody writes news stories about them. But moving forward in a slow and methodical manner doesn&#8217;t mean you lack ambition, drive, or vision. The stained glass artist has a very clear vision. He knows exactly what he is working toward.<\/p>\n<p>You and I can do the same. If we keep making small improvements, then pretty soon we will end up with a beautiful masterpiece on our hands instead of a bunch of fragments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Until recently, I had never been inside a stained glass studio.
