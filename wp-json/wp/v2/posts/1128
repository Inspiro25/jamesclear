We believe that a person is a person through other persons. That my humanity is caught up, bound up, inextricably, with yours. When I dehumanize you, I dehumanize myself. The solitary human being is a contradiction in terms. Therefore you seek to work for the common good because your humanity comes into its own in community, in belonging.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is exactly the type of philosophy that our community embraces.<\/p>\n<h2>Community First<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cYour humanity comes into its own in community, in belonging.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In our little community here, we each have our own goals and mission. Some of us are working to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/eat-healthy\">lose weight and get healthy<\/a>. Others are striving to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/milo\">gain muscle<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/be-happy\">feel happier<\/a>. But regardless of our individual pursuits, we are always a team grinding towards greatness. We are a group of people on a quest to make the world better, not just different. We support each other.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that there is always room at the top. We believe in abundance and we work hard to make life great for everyone in our community. We walk to the tree and enjoy the fruit together.<\/p>\n<p>Happiness comes from combining what we love to do with something that is meaningful. In this community, our goal is to improve your health and happiness so that you can do what you love and contribute something that is meaningful. We believe that we are here to make the world a better place, and we think that happy and healthy people have a better chance to do that than anyone else. That&#8217;s why we share ways to naturally lose fat and gain muscle, reduce stress and feel happier, and boost your energy and creativity.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to share your journey with us and work towards your goals as part of our team, then you&#8217;ll find thousands people who support you. That&#8217;s because we find value in community. We find our humanity in belonging.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We would all love to learn how to be happy.
