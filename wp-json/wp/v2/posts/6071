(i.e. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In many ways, <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/procrastination\">procrastination<\/a> is a fundamental law of the universe. It&#8217;s Newton&#8217;s first law applied to productivity. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.<\/p>\n<p>The good news? It works the other way too. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. When it comes to being productive, this means one thing: the most important thing is to find a way to <a title=\"get started\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/start-succeed\">get started<\/a>. Once you get started, it is much easier to stay in motion. <a href=\"#footnote-1-6071\" id=\"note-1-6071\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><a href=\"#footnote-2-6071\" id=\"note-2-6071\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6081 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/physics-productivity-first-law.jpg\" alt=\"boost your productivity with the physics of productivity first law\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the best way to get started when you are stuck procrastinating?<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, the best rule of thumb for getting started is the <a title=\"how to stop procrastinating\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/how-to-stop-procrastinating\">2-Minute Rule<\/a>. <a href=\"#footnote-3-6071\" id=\"note-3-6071\" rel=\"footnote\">3<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the 2-Minute Rule adjusted for productivity: <strong>To overcome procrastination, find a way to start your task in less than two minutes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Notice that you don&#8217;t have to finish your task. In fact, you don&#8217;t even have to work on the primary task. However, thanks to Newton&#8217;s first law, you&#8217;ll often find that once you start this little 2-minute task, it is much easier to keep moving.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right now, you may not feel like going for a run. But if you put your running shoes on and fill up your water bottle that small start might be enough to get you out the door.<\/li>\n<li>Right now, you might be staring at a blank screen and struggling to write your report. But if you write random sentences for just two minutes, then you may find that useful sentences start to roll off your fingers.<\/li>\n<li>Right now, you might have a creative block and be struggling to draw something. But if you draw a random line on a sheet of paper and turn it into a dog, then you might get your creative juices flowing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/motivation\">Motivation<\/a> often comes after starting. Find a way to start small. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion.<\/p>\n<h2>Newton&#8217;s Second Law of Productivity<\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Second Law of Motion:<\/strong> F=ma. The vector sum of the forces on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector of the object. (i.e. Force equals mass times acceleration.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s break down this equation, F=ma, and how it can apply to productivity.<\/p>\n<p>There is one important thing to note in this equation. The force, F, is a vector. Vectors involve both magnitude (how much work you are putting in) and direction (where that work is focused). In other words, if you want to get an object accelerating in a particular direction, then the size of the force you apply and the direction of that force will both make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Guess what? It&#8217;s the same story for getting things done in your life.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be productive, it&#8217;s not merely about how hard you work (magnitude), it&#8217;s also about where that work is applied (direction). This is true of big life decisions and small daily decisions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you could apply the same skill set in different directions and get very different results.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6077\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6077\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6077 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/physics-productivity-second-law.jpg\" alt=\"boost your productivity with the physics of productivity first law\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6077\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Note: the idea for this image came from artwork created by my friend, Oliver Emberton, in his wonderful post titled, &#8220;<a title=\"oliver emberton\" href=\"http:\/\/oliveremberton.com\/2014\/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide\/\">Life is a game. This is your strategy guide.<\/a>&#8221; Thanks Oliver!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>To put it simply, you only have a certain amount of force to provide to your work and where you place that force is just as important as how hard you work.<\/p>\n<h2>Newton&#8217;s Third Law of Productivity <a href=\"#footnote-4-6071\" id=\"note-4-6071\" rel=\"footnote\">4<\/a><\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Third Law of Motion:<\/strong> When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body. (i.e. Equal and opposite forces.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We all have an <a title=\"average speed\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/average-speed\">average speed<\/a> that we tend to perform at in life. Your typical levels of productivity and efficiency are often a balance of the productive and unproductive forces in your life \u2014 a lot like Newton&#8217;s equal and opposite forces.<\/p>\n<p>There are productive forces in our lives like <a title=\"how to focus\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/how-to-focus\">focus<\/a>, <a title=\"positive thinking\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/positive-thinking\">positivity<\/a>, and <a title=\"how to get motivated\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/how-to-get-motivated\">motivation<\/a>. There are also unproductive forces like <a title=\"how to reduce stress\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/working-hard\">stress<\/a>, <a title=\"sleep better\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/better-sleep\">lack of sleep<\/a>, and trying to juggle <a title=\"too many ideas\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/pruning\">too many tasks at once<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6092 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/physics-productivity-third-law-1.jpg\" alt=\"boost your productivity with the physics of productivity third law\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If we want to become more effective and more productive, then we have two choices.<\/p>\n<p>The first option is to add more productive force. This is the &#8220;power through it&#8221; option. We gut it out, drink another cup of coffee, and work harder. This is why people take drugs that help them focus or watch a motivational video to pump themselves up. It&#8217;s all an effort to increase your productive force and overpower the unproductive forces we face.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6091 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/physics-productivity-third-law-2.jpg\" alt=\"boost your productivity with the physics of productivity third law\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, you can only do this for so long before you burn out, but for a brief moment the &#8220;power through it&#8221; strategy can work well.<\/p>\n<p>The second option is to eliminate the opposing forces. <a title=\"eliminate\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/eliminate\">Simplify your life<\/a>, <a title=\"how to say no\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/how-to-say-no\">learn how to say no<\/a>, <a title=\"jonas salk\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/jonas-salk\">change your environment<\/a>, reduce the number of responsibilities that you take on, and otherwise eliminate the forces that are holding you back.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6090 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/physics-productivity-third-law-3.jpg\" alt=\"boost your productivity with the physics of productivity third law\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you reduce the unproductive forces in your life, your productivity will glide forward naturally. It&#8217;s like you magically remove the hand that has been holding you back. (As I like to say, if you eliminated all of the things distracting you from being productive, you wouldn&#8217;t need tips on how to become more productive.) <a href=\"#footnote-5-6071\" id=\"note-5-6071\" rel=\"footnote\">5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Most people try to power through and hammer their way past the barriers. The problem with this strategy is that you&#8217;re still dealing with the other force. I find it to be much less stressful to cut out the opposing forces and let your productivity naturally flow forward.<\/p>\n<h2>Newton&#8217;s Laws of Productivity<\/h2>\n<p>Newton&#8217;s laws of motion reveal insights that tell you pretty much everything you need to know about how to be productive.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Find a way to get started in less than 2 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not just about working hard, it&#8217;s also about working on the right things. You have a limited amount of force and where you apply it matters.<\/li>\n<li>Your productivity is a balance of opposing forces. If you want to be more productive, you can either power through the barriers or remove the opposing forces.
