I get started but I can\u2019t seem to follow through and stay focused for very long.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m just as guilty of this as anyone else.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I&#8217;ll start one project, work on it for a little bit, then lose focus and try something else. And then I&#8217;ll lose focus on my new goal and try something else. And on and on. When everything is said and done, I\u2019ve stopped and started so many times that I never really made much progress.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you have felt this way too.<\/p>\n<p>This problem reminds me of a lesson I learned while working out one day&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The Myth of Passion and Motivation<\/h2>\n<p>On this particular day in the gym, there was a coach visiting who had worked with thousands of athletes over his long career, including some nationally-ranked athletes and Olympians.<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyTextFL\">I introduced myself and we began talking about the process of improvement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat do the really successful people do that most don\u2019t?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn\u2019t expecting: \u201cAt some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"04BodyText\">His answer surprised me because it\u2019s a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting \u201camped up\u201d to work on their goals. Whether it\u2019s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, \u201cIt all comes down to passion.\u201d Or, \u201cYou have to really want it.\u201d As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really successful people <span class=\"ITAL\">feel<\/span> the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.<\/p>\n<p>According to him, it\u2019s this ability to do the work when it\u2019s not easy that separates the top performers from everyone else. That&#8217;s the <a title=\"difference between professionals and amateurs\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/professionals-and-amateurs\">difference between professionals and amateurs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Working When Work Isn\u2019t Easy<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated.<\/p>\n<p>When I was an athlete, I loved going to practice the week after a big win. Who wouldn\u2019t? Your coach is happy, your teammates are pumped up, and you feel like you can beat anyone. As an entrepreneur, I love working when customers are rolling in and things are going well. Getting results has a way of propelling you forward.<\/p>\n<p>But what about when you\u2019re bored? What about when the work isn\u2019t easy? What about when it feels like nobody is paying attention or you\u2019re not getting the results you want?<\/p>\n<p>Are you willing to work through <a title=\"deliberate practice\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/deliberate-practice\">10 years of silence<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the ability to work when work isn&#8217;t easy that makes the difference.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s Not the Event, It\u2019s the Process<\/h2>\n<p>All too often, we think our goals are all about the result. We see success as an event that can be achieved and completed.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some common examples&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people see health as an event: <em>\u201cIf I just lose 20 pounds, then I\u2019ll be in shape.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Many people see entrepreneurship as an event: <em>\u201cIf we could get our business featured in the New York Times, then we\u2019d be set.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Many people see art as an event: <em>\u201cIf I could just get my work featured in a bigger gallery, then I\u2019d have the credibility I need.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those are just a few of the many ways that we categorize success as a single event.<\/p>\n<p>But if you look at the people who are consistently achieving their goals, you start to realize that it\u2019s not the events or the results that make them different. It\u2019s their commitment to the process. They fall in love with the daily practice, not the individual event.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s funny, of course, is that this focus on the process is what will allow you to enjoy the results anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you want to be a great writer,<\/strong> then having a best-selling book is wonderful. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of writing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you want the world to know about your business,<\/strong> then it would be great to be featured in <em>Forbes<\/em> magazine. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of marketing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you want to be in the best shape of your life,<\/strong> then losing 20 pounds might be necessary. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of eating healthy and exercising consistently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you want to become significantly better at anything,<\/strong> you have to fall in love with the process of doing it. You have to fall in love with <a title=\"identity-based habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/identity-based-habits\">building the identity of someone who does the work<\/a>, rather than merely dreaming about the results that you want.<\/p>\n<p>In other words&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Fall in love with boredom. Fall in love with repetition and practice. Fall in love with the process of what you do and let the results take care of themselves.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article is an excerpt from Chapter 19 of my New York Times bestselling book\u00a0Atomic\u00a0Habits.\u00a0<a title=\"Read more here\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/atomic-habits\">Read more here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article is an excerpt from Atomic Habits, my New York Times bestselling book.
