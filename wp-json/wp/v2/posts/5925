And in 2011, <em>Time Magazine<\/em> named it one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.<\/p>\n<p>Angelou is widely known as a voice for women, especially black women, and her works have courageously covered themes of identity, racism, and family. During an interview with USA Today in 1988, Angelou said, \u201cOne isn&#8217;t necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can&#8217;t be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.\u201d<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Maya Angelou\u2019s Writing Routine<\/h2>\n<p>As you may expect, Angelou\u2019s <a title=\"creative genius\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/creative-genius\">creative genius<\/a> didn\u2019t expose itself without hard work. She was a true master of habits, routines, and consistency.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how she described her writing habits in 1983 interview with Claudia Tate (as covered in Mason Currey\u2019s book <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/daily-rituals\">Daily Rituals<\/a>),<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;I usually get up at about 5:30, and I\u2019m ready to have coffee by 6, usually with my husband. He goes off to his work around 6:30, and I go off to mine. I keep a hotel room in which I do my work\u2014a tiny, mean room with just a bed, and sometimes, if I can find it, a face basin. I keep a dictionary, a Bible, a deck of cards and a bottle of sherry in the room. I try to get there around 7, and I work until 2 in the afternoon. If the work is going badly, I stay until 12:30. If it\u2019s going well, I\u2019ll stay as long as it\u2019s going well. It\u2019s lonely, and it\u2019s marvelous. I edit while I\u2019m working. When I come home at 2, I read over what I\u2019ve written that day, and then try to put it out of my mind. I shower, prepare dinner, so that when my husband comes home, I\u2019m not totally absorbed in my work. We have a semblance of a normal life. We have a drink together and have dinner. Maybe after dinner I\u2019ll read to him what I\u2019ve written that day. He doesn\u2019t comment. I don\u2019t invite comments from anyone but my editor, but hearing it aloud is good. Sometimes I hear the dissonance; then I try to straighten it out in the morning.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Angelou\u2019s routine and her willingness to sit down and do the work for at least five hours each day \u2014 even when it was going poorly \u2014 is just another indication that <a title=\"create on a schedule\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/schedule\">great artists don\u2019t wait for inspiration<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Below, you\u2019ll find a range of quotes from Angelou.<\/p>\n<h2>Quotes and Thoughts From Maya Angelou<\/h2>\n<p>On identity&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;What I represent in fact, what I\u2019m trying like hell to represent every time I go into that hotel room, is myself. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. And I miss most of the time on that: I do not represent blacks or tall women, or women or Sonomans or Californians or Americans. Or rather I hope I do, because I am all those things. But that is not all that I am. I am all of that and more and less. People often put labels on people so they don\u2019t have to deal with the physical fact of those people. It\u2019s easy to say, oh, that\u2019s a honkie, that\u2019s a Jew, that\u2019s a junkie, or that\u2019s a broad, or that\u2019s a stud, or that\u2019s a dude. So you don\u2019t have to think: does this person long for Christmas? Is he afraid that the Easter bunny will become polluted? \u2026 I refuse that\u2026 I simply refuse to have my life narrowed and proscribed.&#8221; <a href=\"#footnote-1-5925\" id=\"note-1-5925\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;When I try to describe myself to God I say, &#8220;Lord, remember me?
