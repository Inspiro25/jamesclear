He was also the co\u2013creator and co\u2013writer of <em>Seinfeld<\/em>, the long\u2013running sitcom which has received numerous awards and was claimed to have the &#8220;Top TV Episode of All\u2013Time&#8221; as rated by <em>TV Guide<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>According to <em>Forbes<\/em> magazine, Seinfeld reached his peak in earnings when he made $267 million dollars in 1998. (Yes, that was in one year. No, that&#8217;s not a typo.) A full 10 years later, in 2008, Seinfeld was still pulling in a cool $85 million per year.<\/p>\n<p>By almost any measure of wealth, popularity, and critical acclaim, Jerry Seinfeld is among the most successful comedians, writers, and actors of his generation.<\/p>\n<p>However, what is most impressive about Seinfeld&#8217;s career isn&#8217;t the awards, the earnings, or the special moments \u2014 it&#8217;s the remarkable consistency of it all. Show after show, year after year, he performs, creates, and entertains at an incredibly high standard. Jerry Seinfeld produces with a level of consistency that most of us wish we could bring to our daily work.<\/p>\n<p>Compare his results to where you and I often find ourselves. We want to create, but struggle to do so. We want to exercise, but fail to find motivation. Wanting to achieve our goals, but \u2014 for some reason or another \u2014 we still procrastinate on them.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the difference? What strategies does Jerry Seinfeld use to beat procrastination and consistently produce quality work? What does he do each day that most people don&#8217;t?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about all of his strategies, but I recently discovered a story that revealed one of the secrets behind Seinfeld&#8217;s incredible productivity, performance, and consistency.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about that what he does and how you can use the &#8220;Seinfeld Strategy&#8221; to stop procrastinating and actually achieve your goals.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20993 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/never-miss-twice.jpg\" alt=\"Learn how to stop procrastinating on your goals with the Seinfeld Strategy\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/never-miss-twice.jpg 700w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/never-miss-twice-140x105.jpg 140w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/never-miss-twice-550x413.jpg 550w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/never-miss-twice-350x263.jpg 350w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/never-miss-twice-260x195.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The &#8220;Seinfeld Strategy&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Brad Isaac was a young comedian starting out on the comedy circuit. One fateful night, he found himself in a club where Jerry Seinfeld was performing. In an interview on <em>Lifehacker<\/em>, Isaac shared what happened when he caught Seinfeld backstage and asked if he had \u201cany tips for a young comic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Isaac described the interaction with Seinfeld&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>He said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;After a few days you&#8217;ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You&#8217;ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not break the chain.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote-1-5212\" id=\"note-1-5212\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that Seinfeld didn&#8217;t say a single thing about results.<\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter if he was motivated or not. It didn\u2019t matter if he was writing great jokes or not. It didn&#8217;t matter if what he was working on would ever make it into a show. All that mattered was \u201cnot breaking the chain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s one of the simple secrets behind Seinfeld&#8217;s remarkable productivity and consistency. For years, the comedian simply focused on \u201cnot breaking the chain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how to stop procrastinating by using the Seinfeld Strategy in your life&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>How to Stop Procrastinating<\/h2>\n<p>Top performers in every field \u2014 athletes, musicians, CEOs, artists \u2014 they are all more consistent than their peers. They show up and deliver day after day while everyone else gets bogged down with the urgencies of daily life and fights a constant battle between procrastination and motivation.<\/p>\n<p>While most people get demotivated and off\u2013track after a bad performance, a bad workout, or simply a bad day at work, top performers settle right back into their pattern the next day.<\/p>\n<p>The Seinfeld Strategy works because it helps to take the focus off of each individual performance and puts the emphasis on the process instead. It\u2019s not about how you feel, how inspired you are, or how brilliant your work is that day. Instead, it\u2019s just about \u201cnot breaking the chain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do to apply this strategy to your own life is pick up a calendar (<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/link\/yearly-wall-calendar\">here&#8217;s an inexpensive one<\/a>) and start your chain.<\/p>\n<h2>A Word of Warning<\/h2>\n<p>There is one caveat with the Seinfeld Strategy. You need to pick a task that is meaningful enough to make a difference, but simple enough that you can get it done.<\/p>\n<p>It would be wonderful if you could write 10 pages a day for your book, but that&#8217;s not a sustainable chain to build. Similarly, it sounds great in theory to be able to deadlift like a maniac every day, but in practice you&#8217;ll probably be overtrained and burnt out.<\/p>\n<p>So step one is to choose a task that is simple enough to be sustainable. At the same time, you have to make sure that your actions are meaningful enough to matter.<\/p>\n<p>For example, researching good jokes each day is simple, but you\u2019re never going to write a joke by merely researching. That&#8217;s why the process of writing is a better choice. Writing can actually produce a meaningful result, even when it&#8217;s done in small doses.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, doing 10 pushups per day could be simple and meaningful depending on your level of fitness. It will actually make you stronger. Meanwhile, reading a fitness book each day is simple, but it won\u2019t actually get you in better shape.<\/p>\n<p>Choose tasks that are simple to maintain and capable of producing the outcome you want.<\/p>\n<p>Another way of saying this is to focus on actions and not motions, which is a concept that I explained in this article: <a title=\"taking action\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/taking-action\">The Mistake That Smart People Make<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Mastery Follows Consistency<\/h2>\n<p>The central question that ties our community together \u2014 and what I try to write about every Monday and Thursday \u2014 is \u201chow do you live a healthy life?\u201d This includes not merely nutrition and exercise, but also exploration and adventure, art and creativity, and connection and community.<\/p>\n<p>But no matter what topic we\u2019re talking about, they all require consistency. No matter what your definition is of a &#8220;healthy life,&#8221; you&#8217;ll have to battle procrastination to make it a reality. Hopefully, the Seinfeld Strategy helps to put that battle in perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t break the chain on your workouts and you\u2019ll find that you get fit rather quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t break the chain in your business and you\u2019ll find that results come much faster.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t break the chain in your artistic pursuits and you\u2019ll find that you will produce creative work on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>So often, we assume that excellence requires a monumental effort and that our lofty goals demand incredible doses of <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/willpower\">willpower<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/motivation\">motivation<\/a>. But really, all we need is dedication to small, manageable tasks. Mastery follows consistency.<\/p>\n<h2>P.S.<\/h2>\n<p>For the last eight months I&#8217;ve written a new article every Monday and Thursday without missing a beat. Simply setting a schedule has helped me keep that pace and I plan to keep it as we move forward.<\/p>\n<p>But I also want to graduate my writing habits to the next level and start writing 1,000 words each day. Some of those words will turn into books and courses, and some of will continue to be my Monday and Thursday posts.<\/p>\n<p>My &#8220;1,000\u2013words\u2013per\u2013day&#8221; chain is currently at 4. (I made it to 5 last week before breaking it for a day.)<\/p>\n<p>You may have a couple false starts yourself, but eventually I&#8217;m hoping that both you and I can simply tell ourselves, &#8220;Don&#8217;t break the chain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-5212\" class=\"footnote\"><p>UPDATE: One year after posting this, I found out that Seinfeld has openly said that he didn&#8217;t come up with this idea and hasn&#8217;t even claimed to used the strategy himself.
