I love being strong as much as the next person, but there is more value in weight training than simply gaining muscle or losing fat.<\/p>\n<p>When I think back on the time I&#8217;ve spent training (around 10 years now), here are the most valuable benefits I&#8217;ve discovered&#8230;<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>1. Pushing Yourself Physically Reveals What You&#8217;re Made of Mentally<\/h2>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I <a title=\"James Clear Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jamesclear\/status\/290315222785339392\">posted an update on Twitter<\/a> that asked the following question&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Just had a great talk about the value of sports vs. reading in life. Have you learned more from pushing yourself physically or mentally?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many of you sent in great answers, but I particularly liked this one from <a title=\"Tom Meitner\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tommeitner\">Tom<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Not sure which \u2014 there&#8217;s tremendous value in each. Mental teaches you about others, physical teaches you about yourself.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Tom explained what I hadn&#8217;t quite been able to put my finger on: there is an incredible amount to be learned from both reading and playing sports, but you&#8217;ll learn more about <em>yourself<\/em> when you push yourself physically.<\/p>\n<p>My experiences have mirrored this. While I&#8217;ve learned a great deal about myself from mental pursuits like <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/best-articles\">writing<\/a> and <a title=\"James Clear Photography\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/photography\">photography<\/a>, I&#8217;ve discovered far more about my mental strength and my ability to overcome failure by playing baseball for 17 years, competing in olympic weightlifting, and battling to achieve certain strength goals.<\/p>\n<p>Challenging your own body is the greatest method for discovering the strength of your mind. Nowhere is this more true than with strength training. There will be days when you don&#8217;t feel like coming into the gym. There will be sets that you don&#8217;t feel like finishing. There will be times when everyone else in the gym will see you fail.<\/p>\n<p>And if you keep showing up anyway, then you&#8217;ll develop the mental fortitude to get past failure, work when you don&#8217;t feel like it, and discover what you&#8217;re really made of mentally and physically.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Weightlifting Solidifies Your Sense of Self\u2013Worth<\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Here\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from a year at the gym &#8230; it doesn\u2019t matter how much weight I can or can\u2019t pull, I can grow, build up strength, whatever\u2019s necessary. I\u2019m not defective.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>There\u2019s confidence that comes with that \u2014 wisdom enough to know when it\u2019s too much weight, confidence enough to know what I can do.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Today\u2019s fluctuating sense of worth, whether man or woman, is dangerous stuff. Confidence changes the kinds of thoughts you have.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u2014 <a title=\"self worth chase reeves\" href=\"http:\/\/icetothebrim.com\/2013\/the-self-made-mans-self-worth-problem\/\">Chase Reeves<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>There is nothing more personal than your own body. Having confidence that you can move yourself through physical space with control and competence is a deeply satisfying feeling that filters into every other area of life. If you set a new personal record in the gym this morning, you can be sure that you&#8217;ll be feeling more confident at work this afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>But weightlifting goes deeper than that. Weight training gives you something to stand on, something to define yourself by. It clarifies who you are in your own mind.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I can lift X pounds. I can do X sets. This is what I&#8217;m capable of. This is who I am.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With weightlifting, there&#8217;s no lying to yourself about what you can and can&#8217;t do. The weight forces you to be honest and self\u2013aware.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely, even if you&#8217;re weaker than you thought you were, there is a satisfaction that comes from knowing where you stand. Most days, life seems to be lived in the gray areas. It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re making progress as a parent, a friend, an employee, or a person. Weightlifting is more black and white. It helps you get past that fuzziness and closer to understanding yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Combine this type of clarity with gradual improvement and your sense of self\u2013worth will skyrocket. You know who you are and you are proving that you can become better than you were before.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I lifted 10 pounds more today than I did last week. I can become better. This is proof.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What could possibly be more confidence\u2013building than direct, undeniable proof that you are becoming a better human?<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, this concrete proof of your improvement can do more for your confidence than all the positive thoughts in the world.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Strength Gives You More Opportunities to Contribute to Life<\/h2>\n<p>After spending more than 10 years analyzing the <a title=\"top regret dying people\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/top-regret-dying-people\">top regrets of dying patients<\/a>, nurse Bronnie Ware said, &#8220;Health brings a freedom very few realize, until they no longer have it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I believe that this freedom \u2014 this enhanced ability to explore, create, connect, and contribute to the world around you \u2014 is one of the greatest benefits of weight training.<\/p>\n<p>What I have gained from weightlifting \u2014 the resistance to illness and injury, the confidence in my abilities and the awareness of my limitations \u2014 has positioned me to make a bigger impact and contribute more value than I could have before training. In my case, that means writing about health and wellness, volunteering for the Red Cross, and <a title=\"James Clear photography\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/photography\">taking photos around the world<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest benefits of weight training: it enables you to transform into a better version of yourself (more confident, more self\u2013aware, more mentally and physically strong), so that you can become a better person for the people around you.<\/p>\n<p>This is why I believe so strongly in our community here. We have a small and committed group of superhumans who care not only about developing strong bodies and minds, but also about contributing to the world.<\/p>\n<p>Our community is filled with people who are challenging themselves to become better physically and who are excited about helping the people around them at the same time. Imagine if you spent your entire day surrounded by people like that? What would your world look like?<\/p>\n<h2>Get the Benefits of Weight Training<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re already a weightlifter, keep at it. If you&#8217;re not, get started.<\/p>\n<p>You are on this planet to do amazing things, and I honestly believe that lifting weights can help you do those things better.<\/p>\n<p>Happy and healthy people have a better chance to live with confidence and contribute value to the world than anyone else.
