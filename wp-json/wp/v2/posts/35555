(That said, you are always welcome to use this general format for your own Annual Review.)<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>1. What went well this year?<\/h2>\n<p>I had a lot to celebrate this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Book sales.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\">Atomic Habits<\/a> launched in October 2018, which meant that 2019 was the first full calendar year it had been available. I came in with big aspirations, but I think it&#8217;s fair to say that book sales have outpaced my expectations. <\/p>\n<p>As of December 2019: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 1.3 million copies sold worldwide<\/li>\n<li>12 consecutive months on the New York Times bestseller list<\/li>\n<li>4.8\/5 stars on Amazon with over 1,800 reviews<\/li>\n<li>4.8\/5 stars on Audible with over 25,000 ratings<\/li>\n<li>Over 15 national TV segments in the United States, Canada, and Australia<\/li>\n<li>Translated into 40+ languages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This has been a wild ride to say the least.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the greatest reward has been hearing from readers. It seems like nearly every day someone tells me that Atomic Habits helped them lose weight or start a business or make some positive change in their life. People are finding real value in the ideas and it feels great to produce something useful. <\/p>\n<p><strong>3-2-1 Newsletter.<\/strong> My new project for 2019 was launching <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/3-2-1\">the 3-2-1 newsletter<\/a>, which shares 3 ideas from me, 2 quotes from others, and 1 question to ponder each week. I had been struggling to write consistently during the first half of the year (discussed below) and this new format offered something I knew I could stick with despite a busy schedule. (Sometimes I have to take my own medicine and scale my habits down.) <\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time, but it turns out to have been a good idea. I feel good because I&#8217;m producing new work each week and the response from subscribers has been quite favorable. Many readers tell me it&#8217;s the only newsletter they actually read as soon as it hits their inbox. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Audience growth.<\/strong> I didn&#8217;t write many new articles this year, but thanks to the buzz generated by Atomic Habits and the momentum of the 3-2-1 newsletter, audience growth remained strong.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the year looked like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 new articles published this year (fewest ever; discussed in next section)<\/li>\n<li>353,970 new email subscribers in 2019<\/li>\n<li>586,638 total email subscribers as of December 31, 2019<\/li>\n<li>10,848,250 unique visitors in 2019<\/li>\n<li>47,308,712 total visitors since launching on November 12, 2012<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even after doing this for a few years, the scale of the internet still blows me away. I&#8217;m grateful to have the opportunity to share my work with so many people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Twitter and Instagram.<\/strong> I didn&#8217;t put much energy into social media for a long time, but the web has evolved in the last five years and social media plays an important role now. This was the first year I put consistent effort into Twitter and Instagram, and it paid off. My audience doubled on both platforms this year. Feel free to join the fun and follow me <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jamesclear\">on Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jamesclear\/\">on Instagram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Travel.<\/strong> This was the craziest travel year of my life and, in all likelihood, the craziest I will ever have. I spent a total of 158 nights away from home this year, which means I spent 43% of the year not sleeping in my own bed. It\u2019s a pace I will probably (hopefully?) never match again.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>18 states (0 new) &#8211; Arizona, California (5x!), Colorado (2x), Florida (2x), Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois (2x), Indiana (3x), Maryland, Nebraska (2x), Nevada, New York (5x!), Ohio, Pennsylvania (3x), Tennessee (2x), Texas (2x), Utah, and Virginia.<\/p>\n<p>14 countries (7 new) &#8211; Australia (2x!), Canada (2x), Croatia, Denmark, Greece, England, Iceland,  Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.<\/p>\n<p>While I love traveling, I did feel a bit guilty about the number of flights I took this year and the resulting pollution. In response, I decided to buy carbon offsets not only to cover my flights, but also to be entirely carbon neutral for 2019. I bought mine through <a href=\"https:\/\/projectwren.com\/\">Project Wren<\/a>, and it wasn&#8217;t nearly as expensive as I expected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New restaurants.<\/strong> Whenever I travel to a new city, I like to ask for restaurant recommendations on Twitter. Oh man, did you all set me up this year. I had so many great meals thanks to reader suggestions. <\/p>\n<p>I feel compelled to repay you all by sharing some of my favorites (in no order):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Los Angeles, CA &mdash; fundamental LA<\/li>\n<li>Denver, CO &mdash; Mercantile Provisions<\/li>\n<li>Honolulu, HI &mdash; Marukame Udon<\/li>\n<li>New York, NY &mdash; Manhatta (my meal of the year)<\/li>\n<li>Philadelphia, PA &mdash; Zahav (runner up)<\/li>\n<li>Melbourne, Australia &mdash; Chin Chin<\/li>\n<li>Sydney, Australia &mdash; NOMAD<\/li>\n<li>Sydney, Australia &mdash; Mr. Wong<\/li>\n<li>Toronto, Canada &mdash; PAI<\/li>\n<li>Dubrovnik, Croatia &mdash; Pantarul<\/li>\n<li>Dubrovnik, Croatia &mdash; Taj Mahal<\/li>\n<li>London, England &mdash; Nopi<\/li>\n<li>London, England &mdash; Dishoom<\/li>\n<li>Athens, Greece &mdash; Atitamos<\/li>\n<li>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia &mdash; Village Park Restaurant<\/li>\n<li>Singapore &mdash; Artichoke<\/li>\n<li>Singapore &mdash; Maxwell Food Court<\/li>\n<li>Madrid, Spain &mdash; El Charrua<\/li>\n<li>Madrid, Spain &mdash; Ten Con Ten<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more ideas (including specific dishes), check out <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1snVPM5av4pacJKB6eQcPOYUWeXigtMzeo30062j6oqo\/edit?usp=sharing\">my full list of recommended restaurants<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking.<\/strong> I delivered 31 paid keynote speeches in 2019. This is far and away the most I\u2019ve ever given in a calendar year. Obviously, this is tied directly to the success of Atomic Habits, but I&#8217;ve improved my speaking skills as well. My biggest takeaway is that if you write about a topic for years and are forced to clarify your thinking in a well-structured book, then speaking about that topic for one hour becomes much easier to do. (Note: If you&#8217;d like me to speak at your company or event, <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/keynote-speaker\">you can submit a request here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<h2>2. What didn\u2019t go so well this year?<\/h2>\n<p>Many wonderful things happened in 2019, but I suffered plenty of growing pains as well. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Writing.<\/strong> For years, my business was built on the consistency of my writing. I published a new article every Monday and Thursday from 2012 to 2015. From 2016 to 2018, I spent most of my time writing Atomic Habits. Overall, those six years were filled with writing.<\/p>\n<p>Then 2019 arrived and the book began to sell far and wide. My attention shifted to promotion mode: interviews, speeches, book signings. It was all great, but there was very little time left for writing. Honestly, I probably wrote more words on Twitter last year than in new articles. <\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, I began to course correct during the second half of the year by writing the 3-2-1 newsletter (as mentioned previously). We&#8217;ll see what things look like in 2020, but if I&#8217;m going to write another book at some point, I will need to carve out more time to write.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weightlifting.<\/strong> Everything has a tradeoff. It turns out that it is hard to maintain consistency in the gym when you are on the road for nearly half the year. In 2019, I completed 91 workouts for an average of 7.6 per month, which is better than nothing, but a steep drop off from previous years.<\/p>\n<p>Workouts per month in 2019:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>January \u2013 16<\/li>\n<li>February \u2013 6<\/li>\n<li>March \u2013 4<\/li>\n<li>April \u2013 8<\/li>\n<li>May \u2013 4<\/li>\n<li>June \u2013 2(!)<\/li>\n<li>July \u2013 12<\/li>\n<li>August \u2013 8<\/li>\n<li>September \u2013 9<\/li>\n<li>October \u2013 15<\/li>\n<li>November \u2013 1(!)<\/li>\n<li>December \u2013 6<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When looking at these numbers, the thing that sticks out to me is that my worst months were the months I had lots of international travel (March, June, and November). I&#8217;ll need a better plan for exercising in foreign locations in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Given how inconsistent things were, I didn&#8217;t bother with max lifts this year and just did rep work most days. As a result, my best lifts of the year were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Back Squat \u2013 330 lbs (150 kg) for 5 rep<\/li>\n<li>Bench Press \u2013 245 lbs (111 kg) for 5 rep<\/li>\n<li>Deadlift \u2013 415 lbs (188 kg) for 5 rep<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This marks the second year in a row when I failed to hit an all-time PR in any major lift. Admittedly, it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;re going to reach a personal best every year anyway, but nonetheless I have a lot of catching up to do in the gym in 2020.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Email.<\/strong> I joked earlier this year that my email response time is either 3 minutes or 3 months. Problem is&#8230; it&#8217;s not really a joke. I&#8217;m terrible at answering email. Honestly, this wouldn&#8217;t bother me except for one reason: it bothers other people.<\/p>\n<p>My poor email response times came back to burn me multiple times this year. Sometimes it was a missed opportunity due to a delayed reply. Other times people became annoyed or frustrated, or thought I was intentionally ignoring them.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure the best way to handle this. I get more email than I can manage and answering emails is certainly not as important as writing the next article or book. And yet, people expect responses within a day or two. One thing is for sure, I&#8217;ll probably need a new email approach in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>3. What did I learn this year?<\/h2>\n<p>Some of my major lessons from this year include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Move fast.<\/strong> The importance of moving fast was clarified for me over the last year. The original release date for Atomic Habits was set for March 2019. I pushed to move the date forward six months to October 2018 because I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on holiday sales around Christmas. My publishing team agreed, everyone worked their tails off, and we had a fabulous launch in October. <\/p>\n<p>What happened next was even more important: The book was available in January when everyone was thinking about New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. As a result, Atomic Habits jumped out to a very strong start during the fall and winter. By the time we arrived at the original launch date in March, we had already sold nearly 500,000 copies. <\/p>\n<p>In this case, the difference between waiting and acting was massive. We all know exactly what would have happened if we had waited: time would have flown by, somehow planning the launch would have expanded to fill all of that time, and six months of sales would have vanished.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Growing up takes time.<\/strong> For the last three years my business has been stuck in that awkward pre-teen stage where one minute it acts like a full-fledged adult and the next minute you realize it&#8217;s covered in pimples and doesn&#8217;t know how to control all four limbs at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>But in 2019&mdash;maybe!&mdash;it turned a corner. The to-do list is still endless, but that&#8217;s what running a business is like. It does feel like I&#8217;m starting to find my footing, however. The strategy is becoming more clear. The products are gaining a foothold. The fog is lifting ever-so-slightly. I have spent nearly a decade as a full-time entrepreneur, but I&#8217;m finally uncovering a clear roadmap of what the future of the business looks like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A life well-lived is a life well-edited.<\/strong> My biggest area of growth this year was prioritization. I had to become much better at <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/saying-no\">saying no<\/a>&mdash; and I&#8217;m still not very good at it!<\/p>\n<p>In short: Prune away the inessential. Pour yourself into what remains.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! As always, thanks for reading.
