I knew people might be reluctant to talk, but most people are happy to accept a bottle of booze, instead of money, in exchange for their help. So I get to the building, find the superintendent, give him a fifth of scotch and like that, he opens up the office.\u201d <\/em><a href=\"#footnote-1-8005\" id=\"note-1-8005\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When Morse walked into Einstein\u2019s office, he snapped a photo of the desk where Albert Einstein had been working just hours before.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody knew it yet, but Einstein\u2019s body would be cremated before anyone could capture a final photo of him.
