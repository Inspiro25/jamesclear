They were working on a rap album, but at this particular moment they were talking about marriage.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nThe first man was someone you would expect to be working on a rap album. His real name was Olubowale Akintimehin, but he is better known as the hip-hop artist Wale (pronounced WAH-lay). The second man was someone you would never expect to be working on a rap album, the popular comedian Jerry Seinfeld.<\/p>\n<p>Wale was partnering with Seinfeld for his fourth album, <em>The Album About Nothing<\/em>. During this particular session, he brought Seinfeld into the studio to ask him questions, record their conversation, and hopefully grab a few soundbites for the album.<\/p>\n<p>While working on a track called <em>The Matrimony<\/em>, Wale questioned Seinfeld about his thoughts on marriage. At first, Seinfeld talked about what it felt like to get engaged. He explained the combination of excitement and nervousness and helplessness that made engagement feel like being strapped into a rollercoaster headed to the top of the hill where the marriage awaits.<\/p>\n<p>Wale paused for a moment, looked at Seinfeld, and said, \u201cSo, even if you make plans you never think you\u2019re really ready for marriage?\u201d <a href=\"#footnote-1-10070\" id=\"note-1-10070\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Seinfeld said. &#8220;It\u2019s like any growth. You can\u2019t be ready for it because it\u2019s growth. It\u2019s going to be new. You\u2019re going to have a new life. You\u2019re going to be a new person.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>You&#8217;re Not Ready for Growth<\/h2>\n<p>I like Seinfeld\u2019s definition of growth. You&#8217;re not ready for marriage. You&#8217;re not ready to start a business. You&#8217;re not ready to move to a new city. You&#8217;re not ready for growth &#8230; and that&#8217;s exactly why it will make you grow. <a title=\"Successful people start before they feel ready.\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/successful-people-start-before-they-feel-ready\">Start before you feel ready<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>By definition, growth must be something that makes you feel unprepared and uncertain. If it was comfortable and easy, it wouldn\u2019t be growth. It would be normal. It would be standard. It would be who you already are.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10093\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10093\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10093 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/jerry-seinfeld-wale-the-matrimony.jpg\" alt=\"Jerry Seinfeld during the recording of The Album About Nothing.
