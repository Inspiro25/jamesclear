Your time should be spent doing the work, not recording it.<\/li>\n<li>Your workout tracker should be useful. Our modern world is overflowing with data and most of it is never acted upon. I prefer a system that records the essential information of what I have done (so I can see my progress), that reduces errors while I am working out (so that I can be more effective with my time), and that helps me make informed decisions about what to do during my next workout.<\/li>\n<li>Your workout tracker should be versatile. I don&#8217;t want to have to find a new app or develop a new system every time I want to do a different style of workout. I should be able to adapt my current system to any style of training.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With those goals in mind, here&#8217;s the workout journal tracking system that has worked best for me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Hacking the Workout Journal<\/h2>\n<p>Naturally, I use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\">Clear Habit Journal<\/a>. Obviously, any notebook will do, but I like this particular one because it is the perfect size and it has a firm cover that doesn&#8217;t bend or tear with repeated use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1:<\/strong> Write the date and your bodyweight (if you wish) at the top of the page.<\/p>\n<p>I typically do this once I show up to the gym. It&#8217;s part of <a title=\"how to get motivated\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/how-to-get-motivated\">the pre-game routine<\/a> that I go through before working out. I put on my lifting shoes and knee sleeves, get out my lifting belt, write the date at the top of the page, and weigh myself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2:<\/strong> Write your planned workout routine for the day in the following format:<\/p>\n<p>[Exercise] &#8211; [Weight] &#8211; [Sets] x [Reps]<\/p>\n<p>At this point, I write out what I expect to do for the day. In the beginning, you may need to think about this a bit or spend some time finding a program that you enjoy. After the first or second time, however, writing down your workout is a very quick task.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, this process takes me less than 60 seconds because I usually <a title=\"measure backward\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/measure-backward\">measure backward<\/a> and base the weights I lift today on what I did the week prior by simply adding 5 more pounds or an extra set. (This is another advantage of using the notebook. Your recent workouts are just one or two pages away, so you can pull information instantly.)<\/p>\n<p>I prefer to write out every set I&#8217;ll do, including warm-up sets, because it makes the process of working out even more mindless and automatic. Once I have a plan, I can just pick up the weights and go. In the rare case that I don&#8217;t know exactly what weight I will hit (for example, if I&#8217;m maxing out on a particular day), then I&#8217;ll just leave a few blank lines under that exercise so that I can write in the numbers as I do each set.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6249 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/workout-journal.jpg\" alt=\"Example of my workout tracker\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/workout-journal.jpg 700w, https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/workout-journal-140x93.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>STEP 3:<\/strong> Record tally marks as you complete your work sets.<\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re in the middle of a workout, it can be easy to forget what set you just completed. This is especially true when the weight gets heavy and you&#8217;re too busy huffing and puffing to remember if you just finished set 4 or set 5.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid this occasional mental lapse, I like to use tally marks to note when I finish each set. One quick mark and I always know where I&#8217;m at in the workout.<\/p>\n<p>For me, the lifting sequence usually goes like this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do the lift.<\/li>\n<li>Make a tally mark.<\/li>\n<li>Start the stopwatch to record my rest interval. (I use the stopwatch application on my phone to track rest intervals, but a regular stopwatch or a glance at the clock on the wall works just fine as well.)<\/li>\n<li>If necessary, change the weight for the next set.<\/li>\n<li>Repeat.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>STEP 4:<\/strong> Vary this basic structure as needed for the training session.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of this system is that it&#8217;s incredibly versatile while still being clean and simple for any given workout. (Most apps and pieces of software meanwhile are either simple but limited, or versatile but bloated with features.)<\/p>\n<p>For example, I rarely add rest intervals to my strength training sessions because they are almost always between 3 to 5 minutes. When I sprint, however, I prefer to have the rest interval listed because it is more integral to the workout. No problem. I just add it to the line under the exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what a typical sprint workout looks like for me&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6248 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/sprint-workout-journal.jpg\" alt=\"Exercise tracker for a sprint workout\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it.<\/p>\n<p>Bodyweight workouts, strength training workouts, sprint workouts\u2014this workout journal works for all of them. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s adjustable, and it works. <a href=\"#footnote-1-6247\" id=\"note-1-6247\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-6247\" class=\"footnote\"><p>In the examples above, I only listed one exercise per workout so that I could lay out the format clearly.
