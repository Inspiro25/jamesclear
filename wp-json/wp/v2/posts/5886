And that danger is falling into an all-or-nothing mindset.<\/p>\n<p>As usual, I don\u2019t have this all figured out, but let\u2019s talk about how to be consistent and how we can use science and research to avoid common mistakes and pitfalls.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The All or Nothing Mindset<\/h2>\n<p>Once you realize that consistency is essential for success it can be easy to obsess over becoming flawlessly consistent.<\/p>\n<p>For example&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trying to get fit?<\/strong> It\u2019s easy to convince yourself that if you don\u2019t follow your diet perfectly, then you\u2019ve failed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Want to meditate each day?<\/strong> Beware of focusing so much on never missing a day that you stress over sticking to your meditation schedule.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Looking to become a successful writer?<\/strong> You can quickly brainwash yourself into thinking that successful authors write every single day without fail. (The same goes for artists and athletes of all kinds.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In other words, it\u2019s really easy to confuse being consistent with being perfect. And that is a problem because there is no safety margin for errors, mistakes, and emergencies. (You know, the type of things that make you a normal human being.)<\/p>\n<p>Cutting yourself some slack becomes even more important when we consider the science behind <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habits\">habit formation<\/a> and continual improvement. Research shows that, regardless of the habit that you are working to build, missing a single day has no measurable impact on your long-term success. (More on that <a title=\"new habit\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/new-habit\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>In other words, <a title=\"average speed\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/average-speed\">it is all about average speed<\/a>, not maximum speed. Daily failures are like red lights during a road trip. When you\u2019re driving a car, you\u2019ll come to a red light every now and then. But if you maintain a good average speed, you\u2019ll always make it to your destination despite the stops and delays along the way.<\/p>\n<h2>The Idea in Practice<\/h2>\n<p><a title=\"Josh Hillis\" href=\"http:\/\/joshsgarage.typepad.com\/\">Josh Hillis<\/a> is a fat loss coach. When working with clients, Josh doesn\u2019t even bother tracking their daily calories. He only looks at the calorie total at the end of each week and makes adjustments based on that.<\/p>\n<p>Consider how different this strategy is from the typical nutritional approach. Josh doesn\u2019t care what you eat for any individual meal. He is not concerned if you make a mistake or binge eat once or twice. He realizes that individual meals don\u2019t matter if you maintain the right \u201caverage speed\u201d over the course of the week.<\/p>\n<p>I find this to be an empowering way to think about consistency and progress in nearly any area. It\u2019s never my intention to make a mistake, but if I do, I have given myself permission to view my progress over a longer timeline than a single day or an individual event.<\/p>\n<h2>How to be Consistent: Plan For Failure<\/h2>\n<p>Consistency is essential for success in any area. There is no way to get around the fact that mastery requires a volume of work.<\/p>\n<p>But if you want to maintain your sanity, reduce stress, and increase your odds of long-term success, then you need to plan for failure as well as focus on consistency. As I mentioned in my Willpower Seminar, research from Stanford professor Kelly McGonigal has shown that the number one reason why willpower fades and people fail to remain consistent with their habits and goals is that they don&#8217;t have plan for failure.<\/p>\n<p>Planning to fail doesn\u2019t mean that you expect to fail, but rather than you know what you will do and how you will <a title=\"get back on track\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/get-back-on-track\">get back on track<\/a> when things don\u2019t work out. If you\u2019re focused on being perfect, then you\u2019re caught in an all-or-nothing trap.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you realize that individual failures have little impact on your long-term success, then you can more easily rebound from failures and setbacks. Being consistent is not the same as being perfect.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You probably realize that consistency is important for making progress, doing better work, getting in shape, and achieving some level of success in most areas of life.
