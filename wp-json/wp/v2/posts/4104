In fact, there are probably many things \u2014 large and small \u2014 that you would like to accomplish.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s great, but there is one common mistake we often make when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/goal-setting\">setting goals<\/a>. (I know I\u2019ve committed this error many times myself.)<\/p>\n<p>The problem is this: we set a deadline, but not a schedule.<\/p>\n<p>We focus on the end goal that we want to achieve and the deadline we want to do it by. We say things like, &#8220;I want to lose 20 pounds by the summer&#8221; or &#8220;I want to add 50 pounds to my bench press in the next 12 weeks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that if we don&#8217;t magically hit the arbitrary timeline that we set in the beginning, then we feel like a failure &#8230; even if we are better off than we were at the start. The end result, sadly, is that we often give up if we don&#8217;t reach our goal by the initial deadline.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve mentioned this idea multiple times before. For example, in making <a title=\"identity based habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/identity-based-habits\">the mistake of putting performance goals before your identity<\/a> or in <a title=\"good habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/why-is-it-so-hard-to-form-good-habits\">choosing life\u2013changing transformations over daily lifestyle choices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the good news: there\u2019s a better way and it\u2019s simple.<\/p>\n<h2>The Power of Setting a Schedule, Not a Deadline<\/h2>\n<p>In my experience, a better way to achieve your goals is to set a schedule to operate by rather than a deadline to perform by.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of giving yourself a deadline to accomplish a particular goal by (and then feeling like a failure if you don\u2019t achieve it), you should choose a goal that is important to you and then set a schedule to work towards it consistently.<\/p>\n<p>That might not sound like a big shift, but it is.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Achieve Your Goals: The Idea in Practice<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the time, I try to be a practitioner of my ideas and not just someone who shares their opinion, so allow me to explain this strategy by using two real examples from my own life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example 1: Writing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As regular readers know, I published a new article every Monday and Thursday for the first three years. Sometimes the article was shorter than expected, sometimes it wasn&#8217;t as compelling as I had hoped, and sometimes it wasn&#8217;t as useful as it could be \u2026 but it got out the door no matter what.<\/p>\n<p>The results of this simple schedule were been amazing. Millions of visitors, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, and a full-time business.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine if I had set a deadline for myself instead, like &#8220;get 1,000 subscribers in 12 weeks.&#8221; There&#8217;s no way I would have written every Monday and Thursday and if I didn&#8217;t reach my goal, then I would have felt like a failure.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, we are slowly building one of the most incredible communities online. (By the way, thank you for all of the emails, tweets, and messages on <a title=\"fat loss\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting\">fat loss<\/a>, <a title=\"lifting weights\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/why-lift-weights\">lifting weights<\/a>, <a title=\"living longer\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/116-years-old-lessons-oldest-living-person\">living longer<\/a>, and <a title=\"identity based habits\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/identity-based-habits\">forming better habits<\/a>. Keep them coming! I&#8217;m always happy to get your questions and I&#8217;ll do my best to help however I can.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example 2: Exercise<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Back in August 2012, I decided that I wanted to do 100 pushups in a row with strict form. When I tried it the first time, I only got 36.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, I might have set a deadline for myself: \u201cDo 100 pushups by December 31st.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I decided to set a schedule for my workouts. I started doing pushup workouts every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So far, the only workouts I\u2019ve missed were on long travel days.<\/p>\n<p>I have no total pushup goal for any single workout. The goal is simply to do the workout. Just like I have no goal for any single article that I write. The goal is to publish the article.<\/p>\n<p>The result, of course, is that after doing 77 pushup workouts I&#8217;ve made a lot of progress. If you&#8217;re interested, you can <a title=\"100 pushups program\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/ccc?key=0ApTNYzC_iYrtdGk5dGhydVJ4Zkt4cjY2MXg3T1VEOVE#gid=0\">see every workout here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Focus on the Practice, Not the Performance<\/h2>\n<p>Do you see how the two examples above are different than most goals we set for ourselves?<\/p>\n<p>In both cases (writing and exercise), I made consistent progress towards my goals not by setting a deadline for my performance, but by sticking to a schedule.<\/p>\n<p>Productive and successful people <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/professionals-and-amateurs\">practice the things<\/a> that are important to them on a consistent basis. The best weightlifters are in the gym at the same time every week. The best writers are sitting down at the keyboard every day. And this same principle applies to the best leaders, parents, managers, musicians, and doctors.<\/p>\n<p>The strange thing is that for top performers, it\u2019s not about the performance, it\u2019s about the continual practice.<\/p>\n<p>The focus is on doing the action, not on achieving X goal by a certain date.<\/p>\n<p>The schedule is your friend. You can\u2019t predict when you\u2019ll have a stroke of genius and write a moving story, paint a beautiful portrait, or make an incredible picture, but the schedule can make sure that you\u2019re working when that stroke of genius happens.<\/p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t predict when your body feels like setting a new personal record, but the schedule can make sure that you&#8217;re in the gym whether you feel like it or not.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s about practicing the craft, not performing at a certain level. (We&#8217;re talking about practice. Not a game, not a game. <a title=\"allen iverson practice\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI\">Practice<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be the type of person who accomplishes things on a consistent basis, then give yourself a schedule to follow, not a deadline to race toward.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the last 6 months, I\u2019ve experimented with a simple strategy that has improved my work and my health.
