But today, he was a junior at Stanford University, majoring in Product Design, and he was sitting in drawing class.<\/p>\n<p>His professor, Jan Molenkamp, asked if Dean could draw the roof of Stanford\u2019s famous Hoover Tower from memory. \u201cWithout looking, can you draw Hoover Tower\u2019s roof?

Years later, he would write\u2026<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For the past three years, I had been a student at the University and ridden my bicycle or walked by Hoover Tower hundreds of times.

We fall into certain patterns and routines \u2014 sometimes good, sometimes bad \u2014 without really being aware of the factors that are driving our choices and actions.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, just as Dean Hovey couldn&#8217;t draw the tower without first being aware of it, you and I can&#8217;t <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/habits\">master our habits<\/a> without first being aware of the decisions and actions we are taking on a daily basis. Awareness is the first and most critical piece for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Without awareness, even the most intelligent and talented people can struggle to make the right decisions on a consistent basis.<\/p>\n<p>This may have you wondering&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>What can you do to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/stethoscope-self-awareness\">raise your levels of awareness<\/a>?

Instead, you need to make an active effort to measure and track what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re doing it.<\/p>\n<p>This is much simpler than you might think and it\u2019s also one of the best ways to kickstart new behaviors. Here are a few examples&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exercise<\/strong> \u2014 I have a good streak going with weightlifting right now. I\u2019ve trained at least once per week for over a year (which includes travel to <a title=\"istanbul photos\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/photo-essay-istanbul-turkey\">Istanbul<\/a>, <a title=\"moscow photos\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/photo-essay-moscow-russia\">Moscow<\/a>, <a title=\"northern italy photos\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/photo-essay-northern-italy\">Italy<\/a>, <a title=\"south carolina pictures\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/photo-essay-south-carolina-coast\">South Carolina<\/a>, Portland, and a handful of other places). And for the last four months in particular, I have been in the gym at least 3 times per week.<\/p>\n<p>It all started when I began tracking my pushup workouts. That simple action prompted me to track the rest of my training with a more watchful eye. It sounds so simple, but writing down how many days I was training each week helped me get my butt in the gym more consistently. (And along the way, I doubled the amount of pushups I could do.)<\/p>\n<p>Further reading: <a title=\"best exercises\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/best-exercises-basics\">6 Truths About Exercise That Nobody Wants to Believe<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Writing<\/strong> \u2014 Before November 2012, I <em>thought<\/em> that I was writing consistently, but I wasn\u2019t. Eventually, I decided to measure my writing output and realized that I was unpredictable and erratic. I wrote when I felt motivated or inspired, which turned out to be about once every three weeks.<\/p>\n<p>After becoming aware of how inconsistent I was, I decided to set up a Monday and Thursday publishing schedule. It\u2019s been 10 months now and I haven\u2019t missed a week. (You can <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/best-articles\">look back in the archives<\/a> and see every article I\u2019ve written.) My Monday and Thursday posts might look like an old habit now, but the only reason I started writing on this schedule is because I measured my output and discovered my inconsistency.<\/p>\n<p>Further reading: <a title=\"difference between professionals and amateurs\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/professionals-and-amateurs\">The Difference Between Professionals and Amateurs<\/a> and <a title=\"average speed\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/average-speed\">What is Your Average Speed?<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Money and Business<\/strong> \u2014 According to many historians, John Rockefeller was the richest man in the history of the world. Recently, I read about his life and learned that Rockefeller was known for tracking every single penny across his massive empire. After reading about Rockefeller&#8217;s strategies, I was inspired to track my own finances even more closely.<\/p>\n<p>What happened? I quickly became more aware of my finances and discovered a handful of places where I could cut costs and increase earnings. Furthermore, my increased tracking and measurement has helped me learn about things like tax efficiency and asset allocation, which I had previously thought very little about.<\/p>\n<p>Notice that in each example above, I didn&#8217;t start by worrying about all the improvements I needed to make. I simply started by becoming more aware of my behavior. I tracked and measured. And by paying attention to what I was doing and how I was spending my time, ideas for improving my habits naturally presented themselves.<\/p>\n<h2>Your Challenge<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>It is all about paying attention.<br \/>\n\u2014Dean Hovey<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nothing happens before awareness. If you aren\u2019t aware of your decisions, then you can\u2019t do anything to improve them \u2014 no matter how smart you are.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, I\u2019d like to challenge you to <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/measure-backward\">measure something<\/a> in your life for the next week.<\/p>\n<p>Pick something that is important to you and make an effort to be more aware of the things that drive your decisions and actions. Don\u2019t worry about changing your whole life. Don&#8217;t judge yourself for not being as good as you want to be. Just pick one thing that\u2019s important to you and measure it. Take stock of it. Be aware of it.<\/p>\n<p>Your awareness and your habits go hand-in-hand. The simple act of noticing what you do is the first step for improving how you do it. If you recognize how you\u2019re spending your time, then the next step will often reveal itself.<\/p>\n<p>If you want more practical ideas for how to build new habits (and break bad ones), check out my book\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/book\/atomic-habits\"><em>Atomic<\/em> <em>Habits<\/em><\/a>, which will show you how small changes in habits can lead to remarkable results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was 1978.
