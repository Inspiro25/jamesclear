Most people in wealthy nations are hovering around the 80\u2013year mark. Women in Japan are the highest, with an average life expectancy of 86 years.<\/p>\n<p>If we use these average life expectancy numbers and assume that your adult life starts at 18 years old, then you\u2019ve got about 68 years as an adult. (86 \u2013 18 = 68) Perhaps a little less on average. A little more if you\u2019re lucky.<\/p>\n<p>(68 years as an adult) x (365 days each year) = 24,820 days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>25,000 mornings.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what you get in your adult life. 25,000 times you get to open your eyes, face the day, and decide what to do next. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve let a lot of those mornings slip by.<\/p>\n<p>Once I realized this, I started thinking about how I could develop a better morning routine. I still have a lot to learn, but here are some strategies that you can use to get the most out of your 25,000 mornings.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>8 Ways to Get the Most Out of Your Morning Routine<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the strategies that I&#8217;ve found to be most effective for getting the most out of my morning ritual.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Manage your energy, not your time.<\/strong> If you take a moment to think about it, you&#8217;ll probably realize that you are better at doing <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/productivity-tip\">certain tasks at certain times<\/a>. For example, my creative energy is highest in the morning, so that&#8217;s when I do my writing each day.<\/p>\n<p>By comparison, I block out my afternoons for interviews, phone calls, and emails. I don&#8217;t need my creative energy to be high for those tasks, so that&#8217;s the best time for me to get them done. And I tend to have my best workouts in the late afternoon or early evening, so that&#8217;s when I head to the gym.<\/p>\n<p>What type of energy do you have in the morning? What task is that energy best suited for?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Prepare the night before.<\/strong> I don&#8217;t do this nearly as often as I should, but if you only do one thing each day then spend a few minutes each night organizing your to\u2013do list for tomorrow. When I do it right, I\u2019ll outline the article I\u2019m going to write the next day and develop a short list of the most important items for me to accomplish. It takes 10 minutes that night and saves 3 hours the next day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Don\u2019t open email until noon.<\/strong> Sounds simple. Nobody does it. It took me awhile to get over the urge to open my inbox, but eventually I realized that everything can wait a few hours. Nobody is going to email you about a true emergency (a death in the family, etc.), so <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/mental-drag\">leave your email alone<\/a> for the first few hours of each day. Use the morning to do what&#8217;s important rather than responding to what is &#8220;urgent.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Turn your phone off and leave it in another room.<\/strong> Or on your colleagues desk. Or at the very least, put it somewhere that is out of sight. This eliminates the urge to check text messages, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. This simple strategy eliminates the likelihood of <a title=\"time management tips\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/time-management-tips\">slipping into half-work<\/a> where you waste time dividing your attention among meaningless tasks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Work in a cool place.<\/strong> Have you ever noticed how you feel groggy and sluggish in a hot room? Turning the temperature down or moving to a cooler place is an easy way to focus your mind and body. (Hat tip to Michael Hyatt for this one.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Sit up or stand up.<\/strong> Your mind needs oxygen to work properly. Your lungs need to be able to expand and contract to fill your body with oxygen. That sounds simple enough, but here&#8217;s the problem: most people sit hunched over while staring at a screen and typing.<\/p>\n<p>When you sit hunched over, your chest is in a collapsed position and your diaphragm is pressing against the bottom of your lungs, which hinders your ability to breathe easily and deeply. Sit up straight or stand up and you&#8217;ll find that you can breathe easier and more fully. As a result, your brain will get more oxygen and you&#8217;ll be able to concentrate better.<\/p>\n<p>(Small tip: When sitting, I usually place a pillow in the small of my back. This prevents my lower back from rounding, which keeps me more upright.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Eat as a reward for working hard.<\/strong> I practice intermittent fasting, which means that I eat my first meal around noon each day. I&#8217;ve been doing this for almost two years. There are plenty of health benefits, which I explained in great detail <a title=\"intermittent fasting\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting\">here<\/a>, <a title=\"intermittent fasting\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/intermittent-fasting-lessons-learned\">here<\/a>, and <a title=\"intermittent fasting\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/reader-mailbag-intermittent-fasting\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But health is just one piece of the puzzle. I also fast because it allows me to get more out of my day. Take a moment to think about how much time people spend each day thinking, planning, and consuming food. By adopting intermittent fasting, I don\u2019t waste an hour each morning figuring out what to eat for breakfast, cooking it, and cleaning up. Instead, I use my morning to work on things that are important to me. Then, I eat good food and big meals as a reward for working hard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Develop a &#8220;pre\u2013game routine&#8221; to start your day.<\/strong> My morning routine starts by pouring a cold glass of water. Some people kick off their day with ten minutes of meditation. Similarly, you should have a sequence that starts your morning ritual. This tiny routine signals to your brain that it&#8217;s time to get into work mode or exercise mode or whatever mode you need to be in to accomplish your task. Additionally, a pre-game routine helps you overcome a lack of motivation and get things done even when you don\u2019t feel like it.<\/p>\n<p>For more details about why this works, read this: <a title=\"how to get motivated\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/how-to-get-motivated\">How to Get Motivated<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>25,000 Mornings: The Power of a Morning Routine<\/h2>\n<p>Just as it&#8217;s rare for anyone to experience overnight success, it&#8217;s also rare for our lives crumble to pieces in an instant. Most unproductive or unhealthy behaviors are the result of slow, gradual choices that add up to bad habits. A wasted morning here. An unproductive morning there.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that exceptional results are also the result of consistent daily choices. Nowhere is this more true than with your morning routine. The way you start your day is often the way that you finish it.<\/p>\n<p>Take, for example, <a title=\"jack lalanne\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/superhumans-jack-lalanne\">Jack LaLanne<\/a>. He woke up each day at 4am and spent the first 90 minutes lifting weights. Then, he went for a swim or a run for the next 30 minutes. For more than 60 years, he spent each morning doing this routine. In addition to being one of the most influential people in fitness in the last 100 years, LaLanne also lived to the ripe old age of 96.<\/p>\n<p>This is no coincidence. What you do each morning is an indicator of how you approach your entire day. It\u2019s the choices that we repeatedly make that determine the life we live, the health we enjoy, and the work we create.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got 25,000 mornings.
