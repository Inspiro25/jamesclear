Mukherjee, who is an oncologist, clearly explains the complexities of cancer treatment and fills the book with surprising and useful insights (<a title=\"narrow your focus\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/narrow-focus\">like this<\/a>).

As Pressfield says, &#8220;The more important a call or action is to our soul&#8217;s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.&#8221; This book is filled with proven ideas and reminders for beating Resistance and doing your life&#8217;s work.<\/p>\n<p>Buy It: <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/the-war-of-art\">Print<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/audiobook\/the-war-of-art\">Audiobook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Surely You&#8217;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!<\/strong> &#8211; by Richard P. Feynman<\/em><br \/>\nRichard Feynman was an insanely curious and brilliant physicist. In addition to working on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos and winning a Nobel Prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics, Feynman had a passion for cracking safes, playing bongos, drawing nude models, chasing women, and pulling pranks \u2014 all of which are covered in this book. He also shares advice for future scientists: Don&#8217;t confuse knowledge with understanding, develop a broad set of skills and tools to use on problems, and don&#8217;t take the expert&#8217;s word for it, figure things out for yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Buy It: <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman\">Print<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/audiobook\/surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman\">Audiobook<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>4-star books<\/h2>\n<p><em><strong>Daily Rituals: How Artists Work<\/strong> &#8211; by Mason Currey<\/em><br \/>\nIn Daily Rituals, Mason Currey documents the daily habits and rituals of more than 150 of the world&#8217;s most famous artists, authors, musicians, and scientists. Many of the individual stories are great, but here&#8217;s one takeaway I had from the book: everyone&#8217;s rituals are unique to their lifestyle, but all great artists share one thing in common\u2014they have a time and space to do their work with consistency and without interruption. Also, a shocking number of these top performers relied on drugs, caffeine, alcohol, and the good ole daily walk to spark their creativity.<\/p>\n<p>Buy It: <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/daily-rituals\">Print<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/ebook\/daily-rituals\">Kindle<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/audiobook\/daily-rituals\">Audiobook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>The New New Thing<\/strong> &#8211; by Michael Lewis<\/em><br \/>\nThe New New Thing is the story of Jim Clark, a brilliant computer scientist who founded three billion dollar companies in Silicon Valley from 1982 to 1999. The author, Michael Lewis, is one of the greatest non-fiction storytellers of our time (I love his ability to weave cliffhangers into true stories).
