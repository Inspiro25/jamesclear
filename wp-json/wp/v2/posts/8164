He placed first in four of the ten events and ran away with the gold medal. Just seventeen years old and fresh out of high school, Mathias became the youngest gold medalist to ever win a track and field event. When news of his victory reached his hometown of Tulare, California, the local factory blew the whistles for 45 minutes straight. He had entered the Olympics as an unknown kid and returned to America as a national hero.<\/p>\n<p>How did a teenage underdog develop the self-confidence required to win a gold medal on the world&#8217;s biggest stage? What type of mindset did Mathias bring to his competitions? And what can we learn from it?<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The Art of Self-Confidence<\/h2>\n<p>Years later, after his own athletic career was finished, Mathias was coaching a young pole vaulter who was struggling to reach a new height on the crossbar. As the story goes, the young athlete failed to clear the bar over and over again. Aware of his deteriorating performance, the athlete looked up at the bar and was filled with fear and frustration. He began to doubt himself and froze up completely.<\/p>\n<p>After pondering the situation for a moment, Mathias looked at the young man and simply said, \u201cThrow your heart over the bar and your body will follow.\u201d <a href=\"#footnote-1-8164\" id=\"note-1-8164\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8165\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8165 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/bob-mathias.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Mathias on how to improve self confidence\" width=\"700\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/bob-mathias.jpg 700w, https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/bob-mathias-519x700.jpg 519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bob Mathias attempting a 4-meter pole vault (13.1 feet) at 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.

If you want, you can hold on to what you know and stay anchored to where you are. However, if you want to rise to a higher level and find out where, exactly, your ceiling is, then you need to throw your heart over the bar and step into the empty space.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: we often think that the empty space is just a stage to pass through. We think it&#8217;s a transition state, a moment of uncertainty on the way to something else. But it can be much more than that. The empty space is where we grow. The empty space is where we develop self-confidence. The empty space is where we reveal who we really are. In many ways, the empty space is where we come alive.<\/p>\n<p>Going through the moment of uncertainty. Facing the period of doubt. That&#8217;s when we discover ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, self-confidence is just persevering through the empty space. Self-confidence is <a title=\"grit and mental toughness\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/mental-toughness\">grit<\/a>. Self-confidence is <em><a title=\"sisu\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/sisu-mental-toughness\">Sisu<\/a><\/em>. Self-confidence is <a title=\"mental toughness and the marathon monks\" href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/mental-toughness-marathon-monks\">mental toughness<\/a>. Mostly, self-confidence is just a willingness to let go of what is comfortable, slide into uncertain air, and trust that you&#8217;ll be ok.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrow your heart over the bar and your body will follow.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><div class=\"footnotetitle\">Footnotes<\/div><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-8164\" class=\"footnote\"><p>It took me a long time to track down the original source of the quote.
