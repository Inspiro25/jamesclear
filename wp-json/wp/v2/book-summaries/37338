Know how to deceive the enemy: appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.

My notes are informal and often contain quotes from the book as well as my own thoughts. This summary also includes key lessons and important passages from the book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"summary\"><li>\u201cAccording as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one\u2019s plans.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cAll warfare is based on deception. Hence when able to attack we must seem unable. When using our forces we must seem inactive. When we are near we make the enemy believe we are far away. When far away we must make the enemy believe we are near.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cAppear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cIf he is superior in strength, evade him.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cAttack him where he is unprepared. Appear where you are not expected.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cThere is no instance of a country having benefitted from prolonged warfare.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cA wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy&#8217;s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one&#8217;s own.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cSupreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\u2019s resistance without fighting.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cThe worst strategy of all is to besiege walled cities.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cThere are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win who\u2019s army is animated by the same spirit throughout all it\u2019s ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself, but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cOne may know how to conquer without being able to do it.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cIn war, the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won.&#8221;<\/li><li>&#8220;In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the direct and indirect.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cAn army may march great distances without distress if it marches through country where the enemy is not.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cYou can be sure in succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cMilitary tactics are like water. For water, in its natural course, runs away from high places and hastens downwards. So, in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cLet your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move fall like a thunderbolt.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cPonder and deliberate before you make a move.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cA clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cIt is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cThe art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy not coming, but on our readiness to receive him.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cMake your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cIf they will face death, there is nothing they will not achieve.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cThe principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.&#8221;<\/li><li>\u201cIf it is to your advantage, make a forward move. If not, stay where you are.&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_5fac7d1f10ccd\" class=\"sale-book \" data-easygut-id=\"salebook\">\n\t<div class=\"sale-book__img\"><img src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/TheArtofWar-by-SunTzu.jpg\" alt=\"\"><\/div>\n\t<div class=\"sale-book__txt\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"sale-book__title\">The Art of War by Sun Tzu<\/h3>\n\t\t<div class=\"sale-book__cta\">\n\t\t\t<span>Buy the book:<\/span>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/book\/the-art-of-war\">Print<\/a>\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/ebook\/the-art-of-war\">Ebook<\/a>\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/audiobook\/the-art-of-war\">Audiobook<\/a>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"sale-book__more\">Or, <a href=\"\/book-summaries\">browse more book summaries<\/a>.<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Book in Three Sentences Know when to fight and when not to fight: avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak.
