My notes are informal and often contain quotes from the book as well as my own thoughts. This summary includes key lessons and important passages from the book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"summary\"><li>On the suffering that often accompanies death: \u201cWith what strife and pains we come into the world we know not, but \u2019tis commonly no easy matter to get out of it.\u201d -Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici<\/li><li>I realized that the questions intersecting life, death, and meaning, questions that all people face at some point, usually arise in a medical context.<\/li><li>Because the brain mediates our experience of the world, any neurosurgical problem forces a patient and family, ideally with a doctor as a guide, to answer this question: What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?<\/li><li>Learning to judge whose lives could be saved, whose couldn\u2019t be, and whose shouldn\u2019t be requires an unattainable prognostic ability. I made mistakes. Rushing a patient to the OR to save only enough brain that his heart beats but he can never speak, he eats through a tube, and he is condemned to an existence he would never want\u2026 I came to see this as a more egregious failure than the patient dying.<\/li><li>As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives\u2014everyone dies eventually\u2014but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness.<\/li><li>One of the earliest meanings of the word \u201cpatient\u201d is \u201cone who endures hardship without complaint.&#8221;<\/li><li>When you take up another\u2019s cross, you must be willing to sometimes get crushed by its weight.<\/li><li>\u201cBoredom is the awareness of time passing.\u201d -Heidegger<\/li><li>The pain of failure had led me to understand that in neurosurgery technical excellence was a moral requirement. Good intentions were not enough, not when so much depended on my skills, when the difference between tragedy and triumph was defined by one or two millimeters.<\/li><li>Death comes for all of us. It is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms.<\/li><li>Dealing with the fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.<\/li><li>Can we become comfortable with the most uncomfortable thing in the world\u2014death? If the weight of mortality does not grow lighter, does it at least grow more familiar?<\/li><li>As a doctor, I was an object, a cause. As a patient, I was merely something to which things happened.<\/li><li>Life isn\u2019t about avoiding suffering. The defining characteristic of an organism is striving.<\/li><li>\u201cEven if I\u2019m dying, until I actually die, I\u2019m still living.&#8221;<\/li><li>The tricky thing about terminal illness (and life, probably) is your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you and then you keep figuring it out.<\/li><li>How do you decide what to do with your life when you\u2019re not sure how much life you have left? Maybe in the absence of certainty we should just assume we\u2019re going to live a long time. Maybe that\u2019s the only way forward.<\/li><li>If you believe that science provides no basis for God, then you are almost obligated to conclude that science provides no basis for meaning and, therefore, life itself doesn\u2019t have any.<\/li><li>No system of thought can contain the fullness of human experience.<\/li><li>Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.<\/li><li>\u201cI sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work, and you are sharing the fruits of their labor.\u201d -The Bible<\/li><li>Graham Greene once said that life was lived in the first twenty years and the rest was just reflection.<\/li><li>Most ambitions are either achieved or abandoned; either way, they belong to the past.<\/li><li>What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reading-suggestions\">Reading Suggestions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a list of authors, books, and concepts mentioned in When Breath Becomes Air, which might be useful for future reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How We Die by Nuland<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_5fac8911114ff\" class=\"sale-book \" data-easygut-id=\"salebook\">\n\t<div class=\"sale-book__img\"><img src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/WHEN-BREATH-BECOMES-AIR-by-PAUL-KALANITHI.jpg\" alt=\"\"><\/div>\n\t<div class=\"sale-book__txt\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"sale-book__title\">When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi<\/h3>\n\t\t<div class=\"sale-book__cta\">\n\t\t\t<span>Buy the book:<\/span>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/when-breath-becomes-air\">Print<\/a>\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/ebook\/when-breath-becomes-air\">Ebook<\/a>\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/audiobook\/when-breath-becomes-air\">Audiobook<\/a>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"sale-book__more\">Or, <a href=\"\/book-summaries\">browse more book summaries<\/a>.<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Book in Three Sentences The memoir of Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in his mid-thirties.
