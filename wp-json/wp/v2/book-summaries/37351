This book has many images from the mid-1980s as well as some from the mid-1990s. In my opinion the more recent images are better. Cool to see the improvement.<\/li><li>He is so good at creating images with high contrast between the foreground and background. Plate 22, Plate 33, and Plate 47 are good examples.<\/li><li>He is great at using vertical tree trunks and spreading branches to fill the frame. See Plate 28.<\/li><li>Many of Burkett&#8217;s images that stun me at first glance are aspen trees in fall. He does a great job of finding backlighting for the leaves and dark backgrounds, but the white trunks really make the images sing.<\/li><li>Burkett is a master of light. He only uses bright light when it enhances the subject. And many of his images in overcast light maintain great dynamic range. See Plate 64.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-my-favorite-images\">My Favorite Images<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plate 4<\/li><li>Plate 18<\/li><li>Plate 19 &#8211; incredible framing<\/li><li>Plate 29<\/li><li>Plate 33<\/li><li>Plate 40 &#8211; awesome use of a brightly colored tree as the background.
