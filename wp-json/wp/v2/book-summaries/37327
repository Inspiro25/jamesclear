It is our opinion of things that determines how we feel about a particular event, not the event itself. Think carefully about how you spend your life because people often spend their lives chasing things that are neither as desirable nor as important as they seem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-manual-for-living-summary\">Manual for Living summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my book summary of Manual for Living by Epictetus. My notes are informal and often contain quotes from the book as well as my own thoughts. This summary also includes key lessons and important passages from the book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"summary\"><li>Some things are in our power and some are not. Examples of things not in our power: reputation, power, and the things that are not our own acts.<\/li><li>Remember, if you think the things that are in the power of others are in your own power, then you will be hindered, frustrated, and annoyed.<\/li><li>If you desire to do great things, then remember that you must give things your full attention \u2014 not just a mild effort \u2014 and leave many other things alone for the time being.<\/li><li>Before setting your sights on a goal make sure that said goal is within your power \u2014 that is, that it is something you actually have control over \u2014 and if it is not within your power, do not let it concern you.<\/li><li>Do not be averted to the things not within your power \u2014 illness, death, disease, etc. \u2014 if you desire anything not within your power, the result will be unfortunate.<\/li><li>&#8220;It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition.\u201d Your opinion of things is what makes them good or bad. You are responsible for your own opinions, thoughts, and feelings.<\/li><li>Most challenges are an impediment to a particular thing, but not to your will or to you as a person. \u201cGoing lame is an impediment to your leg, but not to your will.\u201d<\/li><li>If you get the raw end of a business deal or if someone steals from you or if some small misfortune befalls you \u2014 don\u2019t fret over it. Such is the price of living in tranquility and not allowing every small setback to ruin your life. It is much better to live this way than to try and squeeze every ounce out of each opportunity for you to get more or get what you are owed.<\/li><li>If you seem to be a person of importance to some people, ignore them. Realize you know nothing. If you accept that you are a person of importance, it becomes harder to learn.<\/li><li>Accept the things that come to you \u2014 wealth, power, food, relationships, etc. \u2014 with grace and dignity, but do not desire them before they get to you.<\/li><li>When someone responds negatively to an event \u2014 like crying when their child goes off to college \u2014 offer them sympathy and support, but notice that this event does not effect others. The stranger on the corner does not weep. Thus, it is not the event that is negative, but the person\u2019s opinion of it. Although you may offer outward sympathy and support, do not let such events effect you internally.<\/li><li>I disagree with Epictetus\u2019 point about \u201cwe are all actors and your job is to play the role you\u2019ve been given.\u201d I get that he is making an attempt at saying, \u201cDon\u2019t try to be someone you\u2019re not,\u201d but I think the language could have been better. His phrasing makes it sound like, \u201cYou have no control over your life. If you\u2019re poor, you\u2019re poor. Get over it, accept it, and be happy being poor.\u201d In some ways, useful. In other ways, too much of a fixed mindset for my taste. I prefer a more empowering view of your life and the control you have over it.<\/li><li>Each day, keep in mind that death can be close to you. You will not take your time for granted.<\/li><li>&#8220;Which would you rather have? Money or a faithful and modest friend?&#8221;<\/li><li>&#8220;Observe both the things that come first and the things that follow.&#8221; You can\u2019t just look at someone competing on the Olympic stage and desire that. You must also look at the practice, the effort, the time, and the sacrifice that came before the result. If you consider all of what is required for a task and then still wish to do it \u2026 only then should you proceed because you will properly understand what is required.<\/li><li>&#8220;If a man has reported to you that a certain person speaks ill of you do not make any defense to what has been told you, but reply, \u201cThe man did not know the rest of my faults for he would not have mentioned these only.&#8221;<\/li><li>Do not complain of all the bad things that have happened to you. It is not of interest to others.<\/li><li>If you are doing something that you believe is right do not worry about people who will criticize it wrongly.<\/li><li>Whoa! Chapter 40 is an ancient shout out to female empowerment and equality. &#8220;It is worthwhile to let [women] know that they are valued by men.&#8221;<\/li><li>&#8220;You are neither possession nor speech.&#8221; If you have more money, then you\u2019re just richer than someone not better than them. If you are more eloquent than someone, then you are just better spoken not a better person.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_5fac631f6c402\" class=\"sale-book \" data-easygut-id=\"salebook\">\n\t<div class=\"sale-book__img\"><img src=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ManualForLiving-by-Epictetus.jpg\" alt=\"\"><\/div>\n\t<div class=\"sale-book__txt\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"sale-book__title\">Manual for Living by Epictetus<\/h3>\n\t\t<div class=\"sale-book__cta\">\n\t\t\t<span>Buy the book:<\/span>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/manual-for-living\">Print<\/a>\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/audiobook\/manual-for-living\">Audiobook<\/a>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"sale-book__more\">Or, <a href=\"\/book-summaries\">browse more book summaries<\/a>.<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Book in Three Sentences Some things are in your power and some are not\u2014do not confuse the two and do not desire the things that are not in your power.
