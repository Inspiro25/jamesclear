You get into a rhythm\u2014not necessarily one you love, but one you become comfortable repeating\u2014and the grooves of your daily routine become deeper and more established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speed is perpetually undervalued. That doesn&#8217;t mean you should feel frantic or rushed. In fact, it&#8217;s likely you should eliminate some of the things that make you feel so busy to make space for things you always wanted to do. But it definitely means you should stop letting the days drift by waiting for the moment to be right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop acting like there is infinite time.

These people seldom, if ever engage in deliberate learning and see themselves as neither competent at it nor likely to enjoy it. The social and personal cost is enormous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although negative self-images can be overcome, in the life of an individual they are extremely robust and powerfully self-reinforcing. Deficiency becomes identity: &#8220;I can&#8217;t learn French, I don&#8217;t have an ear for languages;&#8221; &#8220;I could never be a businessman, I don&#8217;t have a head for figures;&#8221;&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people believe firmly enough that they cannot do math, they will usually succeed in preventing themselves from doing whatever they recognize as math. The consequences of such self-sabotage is personal failure, and each failure reinforces the original belief. And such beliefs may be most insidious when held not only by individuals, but by our entire culture.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas\/dp\/1541675126\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">\u200b<em>Mindstorms<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> (lightly edited for clarity)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This question comes from a reader named Mac, who shared <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ColoradoMac21\/status\/1730729019065418230\">\u200bthis story\u200b<\/a> with me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;My dad and I love basketball.
