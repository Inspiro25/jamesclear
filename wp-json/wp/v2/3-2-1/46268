If you&#8217;re writing a book, it&#8217;s easy to spend a lot of time brainstorming titles and dreaming up an outline, but it&#8217;s better to simply write. The book discovers itself as you go. Yes, you&#8217;ll need to go back and organize things, but this is easier to do once you have material. The key is to act first and then organize your thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other projects benefit from early planning. The best way to build a skyscraper is to plan carefully. If you start placing steel beams on day one, you&#8217;re guaranteed to run into problems. It is harder to make changes once you&#8217;ve begun. You&#8217;ll need to tear it down and start over again. The key is to organize your thinking and then act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you need early action or early planning?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Latin adage<\/strong> on the will to achieve:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If there is no wind, row.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: I&#8217;m told the original version was possibly written by Virgil as &#8220;Destitutus ventis, remos adhibere.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MayaCPopa\/status\/1715728902067229171\">\u200b<em> <\/em>\u200b<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investor and mathematician <strong>Jim Simons<\/strong> on beauty:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Be guided by beauty. I really mean that. I think pretty much everything I&#8217;ve done has had an aesthetic component\u2014at least to me. Now, you might think, &#8220;Building a company that&#8217;s trading bonds? What&#8217;s so aesthetic about that?&#8221; What&#8217;s aesthetic about it is doing it right. Getting the right kind of people, and approaching the problem, and doing it right. And if you feel that you&#8217;re the first one to do it right, that&#8217;s a terrific feeling. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing to do something right.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SVdTF4_QrTM\">\u200b<em>Mathematics, Common Sense, and Good Luck<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to have boundaries in life, but sometimes you may feel guilty for enforcing them. Aren&#8217;t I supposed to be generous? Am I unkind if I say no to this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question isn&#8217;t whether to be flexible or firm, but when to be each one. A good life has a healthy mix of selfish boundaries and unselfish giving. You don&#8217;t have to be all things at all times.
