Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.

I feel that I&#8217;m not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people who are in opposition. I think that I&#8217;m qualified to speak only when I&#8217;ve reached that state\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That is probably too tough for most people, although I hope it won&#8217;t ever become too tough for me\u2026 This business of not drifting into extreme ideology is very, very important in life. If you want to end up wise, heavy ideology is very likely to prevent that outcome.\u201d\u200b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/poor-charlies-almanack\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/book\/poor-charlies-almanack\">Poor Charlie&#8217;s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.
