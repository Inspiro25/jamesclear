You learn a lot about what you want in a marriage <em>after<\/em> getting married. You discover what type of career you enjoy <em>after<\/em> doing a lot of work.

In many cases, what you wish you knew ahead of time can only be learned after the decision is made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is nothing left but to pay attention to what you like, continue to iterate, and commit to making the most of each opportunity. There is no perfect decision.

Dreaming alone is seductive, even a little sweet, since it lacks the pain of trying. So it feels proper to prize attempts more than dreams. You should have ideals, but you cannot only love an idealized future, you must cultivate a love of effort, too. If you really want something, then the soul must make demands of the body.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/map.simonsarris.com\/p\/efforts-and-goals-and-joy\">\u200b<em>Efforts and Goals and Joy<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3UopMzX\">\u200b\u200b\u200b<\/a><em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Henry David Thoreau<\/strong> on being effective, not merely efficient:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is not enough to be industrious; so are the ants.
