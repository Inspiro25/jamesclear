It is the fact that writing and marketing are mutually reinforcing\u2014and that I enjoy both\u2014that leads to great results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you combine your strengths? That&#8217;s something I would encourage everyone to think about. You will find talented people in every area of life.

You are also choosing months of lonely typing. If you want to be a bodybuilder, you can&#8217;t only choose the fit body and attention. You are also choosing the boring meals and calorie counting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to want the lifestyle, not just the outcomes. Otherwise, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense being jealous. The results of success are usually public and highly visible, but the process behind success is often private and hidden from view. It&#8217;s easy to want the public rewards, but also you have to want the hidden costs.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poet <strong>Emily Dickinson<\/strong> on the value of small actions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If I can stop one heart from breaking, <br>I shall not live in vain; <br>If I can ease one life the aching, <br>Or cool one pain, <br>Or help one fainting robin <br>Unto his nest again, <br>I shall not live in vain.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: &#8220;<\/em>\u200b<em>If I Can Stop One Heart From Breaking<\/em>\u200b<em>&#8220;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rabbi <strong>Menachem Mendel Schneerson<\/strong> on dealing with challenges:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In every challenge or even tragedy, there is an opportunity.
