There will be a lot of those \u2014 in the official capacity as well as the self-appointed. Suffer them if you can&#8217;t escape them, but once you have steered clear of them, give them the shortest shrift possible. Above all, try to avoid telling stories about the unjust treatment you received at their hands; avoid it no matter how receptive your audience may be. Tales of this sort extend the existence of your antagonists; most likely they are counting on your being talkative and relating your experience to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By himself, no individual is worth an exercise in injustice (or for that matter, in justice). The ratio of one-to-one doesn&#8217;t justify the effort: it&#8217;s the echo that counts. That&#8217;s the main principle of any oppressor, whether state-sponsored or autodidact. Therefore, steal, or still, the echo, so that you don&#8217;t allow an event, however unpleasant or momentous, to claim any more time than it took for it to occur. What your foes do derives its significance or consequence from the way you react. Therefore, rush through or past them as though they were yellow and not red lights. Don&#8217;t linger on them mentally or verbally; don&#8217;t pride yourself on forgiving or forgetting them \u2014 worse come to worse, do the forgetting first. This way you&#8217;ll spare your brain cells a lot of useless agitation; this way, perhaps, you may even save those pigheads from themselves, since the prospect of being forgotten is shorter than that of being forgiven. So flip the channel: you can&#8217;t put this network out of circulation, but at least you can reduce its ratings.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/4avcYOm\">\u200b<em>On Grief and Reason<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the situation actually complicated or is it really quite straightforward, but you&#8217;re making it complicated because it requires a lot of courage to make the straightforward decision?<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_ad6ffeaa1759576d4c90db743895b36d\" class=\"twitter-share \" data-easygut-id=\"twitter\">\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/7KWv3\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"27\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 27\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\">\n<circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"14\" r=\"12\" fill=\"#EDEADE\"\/>\n<path d=\"M16.3613 12.1406C16.791 11.8184 17.1777 11.4316 17.4785 10.9805C17.0918 11.1523 16.6406 11.2812 16.1895 11.3242C16.6621 11.0449 17.0059 10.6152 17.1777 10.0781C16.748 10.3359 16.2539 10.5293 15.7598 10.6367C15.3301 10.1855 14.75 9.92773 14.1055 9.92773C12.8594 9.92773 11.8496 10.9375 11.8496 12.1836C11.8496 12.3555 11.8711 12.5273 11.9141 12.6992C10.0449 12.5918 8.36914 11.6895 7.25195 10.3359C7.05859 10.6582 6.95117 11.0449 6.95117 11.4746C6.95117 12.248 7.33789 12.9355 7.96094 13.3438C7.5957 13.3223 7.23047 13.2363 6.92969 13.0645V13.0859C6.92969 14.1816 7.70312 15.084 8.73438 15.2988C8.5625 15.3418 8.34766 15.3848 8.1543 15.3848C8.00391 15.3848 7.875 15.3633 7.72461 15.3418C8.00391 16.2441 8.8418 16.8887 9.83008 16.9102C9.05664 17.5117 8.08984 17.877 7.03711 17.877C6.84375 17.877 6.67188 17.8555 6.5 17.834C7.48828 18.4785 8.66992 18.8438 9.95898 18.8438C14.1055 18.8438 16.3613 15.4277 16.3613 12.4414C16.3613 12.334 16.3613 12.248 16.3613 12.1406Z\" fill=\"#111111\"\/>\n<\/svg>\n<\/a><\/div>\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/7KWv3\">Share this on Twitter<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear \u200b<br><em>Author of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS9hdG9taWMtaGFiaXRz\">\u200b<em>Atomic Habits<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>, the #1 best-selling book <\/em><br><em>Creator of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvYXRvbXMtZnJvbS1hdG9taWMtaGFiaXRzL2lkNjQ3NDQyMTkwNg==\">\u200b<em>Atoms<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>, the official Atomic Habits app <\/em><br><em>Writer of the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS8zLTItMQ==\">\u200b<em>3-2-1 newsletter<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> with 3 million subscribers<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. \u200b<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Screenshot-2024-04-11-at-10.29.28-AM.png\">The only way to browse the internet<\/a>\u200b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to worry about progressing slowly.
