Try one and if you don\u2019t like it, put it back and try another. The cost of a mistake is low, so move quickly and try a bunch of hats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some decisions are like haircuts. You can fix a bad one, but it won\u2019t be quick and you might feel foolish for awhile. That said, don&#8217;t be scared of a bad haircut. Trying something new is usually a risk worth taking. If it doesn&#8217;t work out, by this time next year you will have moved on and so will everyone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few decisions are like tattoos. Once you make them, you have to live with them. Some mistakes are irreversible. Maybe you&#8217;ll move on for a moment, but then you&#8217;ll glance in the mirror and be reminded of that choice all over again. Even years later, the decision leaves a mark. When you&#8217;re dealing with an irreversible choice, move slowly and think carefully.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hat tip to Tim Ferriss, who once compared making decisions to choosing a sweater, which sent me down this line of thinking.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Science fiction writer <strong>Philip K.
