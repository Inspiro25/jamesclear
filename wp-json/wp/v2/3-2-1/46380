Each individual wants to make their own dreams a reality. If someone hands you the whole thing on a silver platter, they gift you the result, but rob you of the accomplishment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember this not only when chasing your dreams, but also when supporting others. Help along the way, but let them run their own race. Your job is to live life with them, not live their life for them.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel writer <strong>Freya Stark<\/strong> on how to have style:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Style\u2014to renounce all but the essential, so that the essential may speak.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/4e9XjWb\">\u200b<em>The Journey&#8217;s Echo<\/em>\u200b<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MayaCPopa\/status\/1715728902067229171\">\u200b<em> <\/em>\u200b<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch painter <strong>Vincent van Gogh<\/strong> \u2014 who sold only one painting during his life \u2014 on self-worth:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If I am worth anything later, I am worth something now.
