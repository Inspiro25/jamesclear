Most days will be boring, but if you write something each day, then you&#8217;ll have 5 to 10 entertaining stories within a year or two. People are sitting on more funny stories than they realize because they do not have a habit of capturing humorous things as they happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Write down one idea each day. Most ideas will be simple and uninteresting, but within a year you&#8217;ll have a handful that are compelling and useful. Little bits of genius are bubbling up all the time, but you need a habit of recording your ideas in order to capture the good ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a myth that great storytellers only think of great stories or that insightful people only have brilliant ideas. But they do have a habit of capturing their experiences and insights, and the patience to filter the majority until the best remain.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesuit priest <strong>Anthony de Mello<\/strong> encourages us to focus on the message before the messenger:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sinners often speak the truth.
