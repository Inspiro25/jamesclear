Those are the two time frames worth prioritizing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 years is shorthand for thinking longer-term than nearly everyone else and doing things that are really ambitious or meaningful. Most of the deeply meaningful things in life require long time horizons: building a business, cultivating a happy marriage, growing a family, getting in the best shape of your life, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you work toward the 10-year things? In 1 hour increments. 1 hour is shorthand for doing things that can be accomplished from start to finish in a single session like a good workout, a good writing session, reading a chapter of a book, going on a fun date, etc. The key is that you finish with something accomplished, not with half-work still waiting to be completed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you spend 1 hour working toward a 10-year project\u2014and you repeat this day after day\u2014you&#8217;re going to end up living a lovely life.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physician and YouTuber <strong>Ali Abdaal<\/strong> shares a useful bit of advice he received from one of his medical school professors:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;An hour before 9 is worth 2 after 5.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AliAbdaal\/status\/1654425583286120448\"><em>Twitter<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actress and dancer <strong>Joan Crawford<\/strong> on how to host a good party:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe best parties are a wild mixture. Take some corporation presidents, add a bearded painter, a professional jockey, your visiting friends from Brussels, a politician, a hairdresser, and a professor of physics, toss them all together, and try to get them to stop talking long enough to eat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s especially important to have all age groups. I&#8217;ve never noticed any generation gap. All the younger people I know are bright and attractive and have something to say and they dress like human beings. They love to listen, too.
