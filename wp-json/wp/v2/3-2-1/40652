I would relax. I would limber up. I would be sillier than I have been this trip. I know of very few things that I would take seriously. I would be crazier. I would be less hygienic. I would take more chances. I would take more trips. I would climb more mountains, and swim more rivers. I would burn up more gasoline. I would eat more ice cream and less bran. I would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary ones. You see, I am one of those fellows who live prudently and prophylactically and sensibly and sanely, hour after hour, day after day. Oh, I have had my moments, and if I had it to do over again, I&#8217;d have more of them a lot more of them. In fact, I&#8217;d try to have nothing else. Just moments, one after another, instead of living so many years, so many years ahead every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been one of those persons who never goes anywhere without a thermometer, a hot-water bottle, a gargle, a raincoat, and a parachute. If I had it to do over, I would go places and do things and travel lighter than I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had my life to live over, I would start barefooted earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would play hookey more. I wouldn&#8217;t make such good grades except by accident. I would have more dogs. I would have more sweethearts. I would keep later hours. I would have more headaches. I would fish more. I would go to more circuses. I would go to more dances. I would ride on more merry-go-rounds. I&#8217;d pick more daisies.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/The_Journal_of_Health_and_Physical_Educa\/_RdMAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22I%27d%20Pick%20More%20Daisies%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I&#8217;d Pick More Daisies<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which of my relationships are win-win?
