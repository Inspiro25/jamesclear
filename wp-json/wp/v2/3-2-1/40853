There was a time when I felt lousy about my over-forty body, saw myself as too fat, too this, or too that. Yet I fantasized about finding a lover who would give me the gift of being loved as I am.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is silly, isn&#8217;t it, that I would dream of someone else offering to me the acceptance and affirmation I was withholding from myself. This was a moment when the maxim &#8220;You can never love anybody if you are unable to love yourself&#8221; made clear sense. And I add, &#8220;Do not expect to receive the love from someone else you do not give yourself.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060959479\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0060959479&amp;linkId=54935e41bfe3c0c415e65c7a8c808883\">All About Love: New Visions<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author <strong>Toni Morrison<\/strong> on how to get better at writing\u2014or anything, really:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I thought of myself as like the jazz musician: someone who practices and practices and practices in order to be able to invent and to make his art look effortless and graceful.
