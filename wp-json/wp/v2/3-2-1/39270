Among the people will be those you most love, as well as those you least know. Seldom is it their intent to purposely hurt you, but rather, a variety of situations mostly beyond your control will cause them to act, speak, or think in ways which can have an adverse effect upon you, your present feelings and emotions, and the way your life upholds. It has been this way through six thousand years of recorded history, and your hurt or grief is not the first time a human has been deeply hurt by the inappropriate actions of another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to avoid being touched by life\u2014the good as well as the bad\u2014is to withdraw from society, and even then you will disappoint yourself, and your imagining about what is going on out there will haunt you and hurt you. Knowing this, there is but one solution that will support you when people and events hurt you, and that is to learn to work harder on your personal growth than anything else. Since you cannot control the weather, or the traffic, or the one you love, or your neighbors, or your boss, then you must learn to control you \u2026 the one whose response to the difficulties of life really counts.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0939490005\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0939490005&amp;linkId=71d4e076e6ef9cfbafe6c71513bf27d6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Seasons of Life<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a question that a reader shared with me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you have to pass through the fire.
