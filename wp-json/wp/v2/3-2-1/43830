For what is really easy, as I found, is to blind one\u2019s eyes to what one really likes, to drift into accepting one&#8217;s wants ready-made from other people, and to evade the continual day to day sifting of values.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/43sPrdM\"><em>A Life of One&#8217;s Own<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mike Markkula,<\/strong> an electrical engineer and investor who worked alongside Steve Jobs and eventually became the first chairman of Apple Computer, shares a few of the company&#8217;s core principles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Apple Marketing Philosophy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy.
