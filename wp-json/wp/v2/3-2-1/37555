In memory of her, I wanted to share one of my favorite quotes from her on critiquing your own work&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interviewer:&nbsp;<\/strong>&#8220;Did you know as a child you wanted to be a writer?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Toni Morrison:<\/strong>&nbsp;&#8220;No. I wanted to be a reader. I thought everything that needed to be written had already been written or would be. I only wrote the first book because I thought it wasn\u2019t there, and I wanted to read it when I got through. I am a pretty good reader. I love it. It is what I do, really. So, if I can read it, that is the highest compliment I can think of. People say, I write for myself, and it sounds so awful and so narcissistic, but in a sense if you know how to read your own work\u2014 that is, with the necessary critical distance\u2014it makes you a better writer and editor. When I teach creative writing, I always speak about how you have to learn how to read your work; I don\u2019t mean enjoy it because you wrote it. I mean, go away from it, and read it as though it is the first time you\u2019ve ever seen it. Critique it that way. Don\u2019t get all involved in your thrilling sentences and all that\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the same interview, she adds:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;After all, this is my work. I have to take full responsibility for doing it right as well as doing it wrong. Doing it wrong isn\u2019t bad, but doing it wrong and thinking you\u2019ve done it right is.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theparisreview.org\/interviews\/1888\/toni-morrison-the-art-of-fiction-no-134-toni-morrison?__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toni Morrison, The Art of Fiction No. 134<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>II.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morrison\u2019s quote pairs well with the following&nbsp;passage from&nbsp;<strong>Stewart Butterfield<\/strong>, the founder of Slack. Today, Slack is a software company valued at billions of dollars. However, back in 2013, Butterfield sent a memo to his team two weeks before the product launched. In it, he explained&nbsp;to his team what it would take to create something great:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is very difficult to approach Slack with beginner\u2019s mind. But we have to, all of us, and we have to do it every day, over and over and polish every rough edge off until this product is as smooth as lacquered mahogany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Each of you knows &#8216;really good.&#8217; Each of you is able to see when things are not done well. Certainly, we all complain enough about other people\u2019s software, and we all know how important first impressions are in our own judgments. That is exactly how others will evaluate us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Putting yourself in the mind of someone who is coming to Slack for the first time \u2014 especially a real someone, who is being made to try this thing by their boss, who is already a bit hangry because they didn\u2019t have time for breakfast, and who is anxious about finishing off a project before they take off for the long weekend \u2014 putting yourself in their mind means looking at Slack the way you look at some random piece of software in which you have no investment and no special interest. Look at it hard, and find the things that do not work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Be harsh, in the interest of being excellent.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@stewart\/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d?__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We Don&#8217;t Sell Saddles Here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h--1\">&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, here&#8217;s a tough question to consider this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long will you put off what you are capable of doing just to continue what you are comfortable doing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear<br><em>Author of the New York Times bestselling book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/?__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atomic Habits<\/a><\/em><br><em>Creator of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/habitsacademy.com\/?__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Habits Academy<\/a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal?__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Habit Journal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/writing-another-book.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;James, are you planning to write another book?&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I.
