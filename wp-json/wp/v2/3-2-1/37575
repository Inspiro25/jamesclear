You can start by asking a question. Simply asking, &#8220;How can I be a better friend?&#8221; or &#8220;How can I be a healthy person?&#8221; will call forth answers naturally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the beginning, just repeating the question is enough.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>III.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Real wealth is not about money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real wealth is:<br>-not having to go to meetings<br>-not having to spend time with jerks<br>-not being locked into status games<br>-not feeling like you have to say \u201cyes\u201d<br>-not worrying about others claiming your time and energy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real wealth is about freedom. Money can help achieve these things, but there are plenty of people who make lots of money yet aren&#8217;t free.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harry Browne<\/strong>, an American writer and politician, in a letter to his daughter on Christmas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to give you something that will stay with you for more than a few months or years. I want to give you a gift that might remind you of me every Christmas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If I could give you just one thing, I\u2019d want it to be a simple truth that took me many years to learn. If you learn it now, it may enrich your life in hundreds of ways. And it may prevent you from facing many problems that have hurt people who have never learned it. The truth is simply this: No one owes you anything.<br>\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You owe it to yourself to be the best person possible. Because if you are, others will want to be with you, want to provide you with the things you want in exchange for what you\u2019re giving to them. Some people will choose not to be with you for reasons that have nothing to do with you. When that happens, look elsewhere for the relationships you want. Don\u2019t make someone else\u2019s problem your problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once you learn that you must earn the love and respect of others, you\u2019ll never expect the impossible and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Others don\u2019t have to share their property with you, nor their feelings or thoughts. If they do, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve earned these things. And you have every reason to be proud of the love you receive, your friends\u2019 respect, the property you\u2019ve earned. But don\u2019t ever take them for granted. If you do, you could lose them. They\u2019re not yours by right; you must always earn them.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.harrybrowne.org\/articles\/GiftDaughter.htm\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.harrybrowne.org\/articles\/GiftDaughter.htm\">A Gift for My Daughter<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>II.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Pirsig<\/strong>, an American philosopher and author:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The place to improve the world is first in one&#8217;s own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060839872\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0060839872&amp;linkId=e7dce9cb96c8f0b53936d208eb57a330\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060839872\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0060839872&amp;linkId=e7dce9cb96c8f0b53936d208eb57a330\">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last 10 years, what has become more important to you?
