They have been either walking, or reading, or writing, or thinking. The only trouble is that they do it about a great many things and I do it about one. If they took the time in question and applied it in one direction, to one object, they would succeed. Success is sure to follow such application. The trouble lies in the fact that people do not have an object, one thing, to which they stick, letting all else go. Success is the product of the severest kind of mental and physical application.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00879YLMO\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00879YLMO&amp;linkId=fefcfea80cdc467756a6eca4483f1c58\">How They Succeeded<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What can you work on today that will continue working for you years from now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear<br><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Author of the million-copy bestseller,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\">Atomic Habits<\/a><br><\/em><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Creator of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\">Habit Journal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/same-shuffle.png\">Same<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Where you spend your attention is where you spend your life.&#8221; II. &#8220;You always hold the rights to your effort, but never to your results.
