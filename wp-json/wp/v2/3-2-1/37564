That sounds goody-two-shoes, I know, but I believe that a diamond is the result of extreme pressure and time. Less time is crystal. Less than that is coal. Less than that is fossilized leaves. Less than that it\u2019s just plain dirt. In all my work, in the movies I write, the lyrics, the poetry, the prose, the essays, I am saying that we may encounter many defeats\u2014maybe it\u2019s imperative that we encounter the defeats\u2014but we are much stronger than we appear to be and maybe much better than we allow ourselves to be.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theparisreview.org\/interviews\/2279\/maya-angelou-the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.theparisreview.org\/interviews\/2279\/maya-angelou-the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou, The Art of Fiction No. 119<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>II.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter L. Bernstein<\/strong>, the famous investor, on how to make better decisions when investing and in life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou have to keep reminding yourself: We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with anything, ever, over any period. And so it\u2019s inevitable that a certain percentage of our decisions will be wrong. There\u2019s just no way we can always make the right decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an idiot. But it does mean you must focus on how serious the consequences could be if you turn out to be wrong: Suppose this doesn\u2019t do what I expected it to do\u2014not just because it goes bad, but even if it just doesn\u2019t go up enough. What\u2019s gonna be the impact on me? If it goes wrong, how wrong could it go and how much will it matter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;[This] doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be convinced beyond doubt that you are right. But you have to think about the consequences of what you\u2019re doing and establish that you can survive them if you\u2019re wrong. Consequences are more important than probabilities. This isn\u2019t just a paradigm for always coming out with conservative decisions. It\u2019s really how you should make decisions, period.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/jasonzweig.com\/a-long-chat-with-peter-l-bernstein\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/jasonzweig.com\/a-long-chat-with-peter-l-bernstein\/\">A (Long) Chat with Peter L.
