To be good \u2014 many people think that they\u2019ll achieve it by doing no harm \u2014 and that\u2019s a lie, and you said yourself in the past that it was a lie. That leads to stagnation, to mediocrity&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t know how paralyzing it is, that stare from a blank canvas that says to the painter, &#8220;You can\u2019t do anything.&#8221; The canvas has an idiotic stare, and mesmerizes some painters so that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the truly passionate painter who dares \u2014 and who has once broken the spell of &#8220;You can\u2019t.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life itself likewise always turns towards one an infinitely meaningless, discouraging, dispiriting blank side on which there is nothing, any more than on a blank canvas. But however meaningless and vain, however dead life appears, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, and who knows something, doesn\u2019t let himself be fobbed off like that.
