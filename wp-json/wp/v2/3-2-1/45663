The only path I know for figuring out a better way to spend your life is to sit and think. You simply have to carve out some time to think carefully about what you&#8217;re doing, why you&#8217;re doing it, and what you&#8217;re really trying to achieve. Nobody stumbles into a well lived life. It has to be cultivated. Reflection and review are critical.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Jobs<\/strong> explains the secret to focus:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&#8217;ve got to focus on. But that&#8217;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&#8217;m actually as proud of the things we haven&#8217;t done as the things we have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: Worldwide Developers Conference 1997<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writer <strong>C. Raymond Beran<\/strong> on friendship:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What is a friend? I will tell you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a person with whom you dare to be yourself. Your soul can be naked with him. He seems to ask of you to put on nothing, only to be what you are. He does not want you to be better, or worse. When you are with him, you feel as a prisoner feels who has been declared innocent. You do not have to be on your guard. You can say what you think, so long as it is genuinely you. He understands those contradictions in your nature that lead others to misjudge you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With him you breathe freely. You can avow your little vanities and envies and hates and vicious sparks, your meannesses and absurdities and, in opening them up to him, they are lost, dissolved on the white ocean of his loyalty. He understands. You do not have to be careful. You can abuse him, neglect him, tolerate him. Best of all, you can keep still with him. It makes no matter. He likes you. He is like fire that purges to the bone. He understands. He understands. You can weep with him, sin with him, laugh with him, pray with him. Through it all\u2014and underneath\u2014he sees, knows and loves you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend? What is a friend? Just one, I repeat, with whom you dare to be yourself.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: The oldest source is an untitled book of poems for 1926, but Beran&#8217;s authorship is occasionally disputed.
