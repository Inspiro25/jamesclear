At a certain moment in his life, the idea came to him of what he called &#8220;the love of your fate.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your fate is, whatever the hell happens, you say, &#8220;This is what I need.&#8221; It may look like a wreck, but go at it as though it were an opportunity, a challenge. If you bring love to that moment \u2014 not discouragement \u2014 you will find the strength is there. Any disaster you can survive is an improvement in your character, your stature, and your life. What a privilege!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when looking back at your life, you will see that the moments which seemed to be great failures followed by wreckage were the incidents that shaped the life you have now. The crisis throws you back, and when you are required to exhibit strength, it comes.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Reflections-Art-Living-Campbell-Companion\/dp\/0060926171\/\">\u200b<em>Reflections on the Art of Living<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> (edited lightly for clarity)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hat tip to <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/DylanoA4\/status\/1805978624702501103\">\u200b<em>Dylan O&#8217;Sullivan<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to handle pressure is to apply it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you played the game like you were always on offense?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(\u200b<a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/Kma0z\">\u200b<em>Share this on X<\/em>\u200b\u200b<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/atomic-habits\">\u200b\u200b\u200b<\/a> <br><em>Author of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/atomic-habits\">\u200b<em>Atomic Habits<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> <\/em><br><em>Creator of the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/3-2-1\">\u200b<em>3-2-1 Newsletter<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> <\/em><br><em>Founding Author of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/authorsequity.com\/\">\u200b<em>Authors Equity<\/em>\u200b<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. \u200b<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Google-Chrome-2024-11-27-15.06.46.png\">So are you seeing anyone<\/a>\u200b?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;You can lose yourself one small compromise at a time.
