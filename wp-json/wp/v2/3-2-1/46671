It is our truest form of magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing allows you to conjure up something of value where nothing previously existed. It costs little for you to write down the lessons of your life and yet those few minutes spent writing can be life-altering for the right reader. As I once saw it put: &#8220;there is someone out there with a wound in the exact shape of your words.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, writing is the foundation of nearly every technology and innovation because we have to record what we know before we can build upon it. And these innovations are passed down from generation to generation, allowing our children to inherit a richer intellectual fortune than what we were born into. The world is richer because we write and nobody is made poorer in the process.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writer<strong> Susan Sontag<\/strong> on finding the courage to change this year:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I must change my life so that I can live it, not wait for it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3VXTZ9J\">\u200b<em>Reborn: Journals and Notebooks<\/em>\u200b<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3UopMzX\">\u200b\u200b\u200b<\/a><em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charles Hayward,<\/strong> a cabinet maker and editor of <em>The Woodworker<\/em> magazine, on starting the year with enthusiasm:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a dynamic quality about enthusiasm which nothing can resist. You can see it in the street orator, whose whole heart is in his argument, swaying a crowd. You can feel it in the work of any artist\u2014painter, writer, musician, or whatever he be\u2014if he has put himself into the thing he has wrought in, felt it enough, suffered it enough. And the beginning of the year is a good time, it seems to me, to set about enkindling our enthusiasm afresh. For life is a dead thing without it. Make it woodwork, if our tastes lie in that direction; make it stamp collecting; make it anything in the wide world so long as it is alive and vital.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: &#8220;A New Year Spirit,&#8221; Woodworker Magazine (1938)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad things are always happening loudly: the injury, the flat tire, the mistake that gets you criticized.
