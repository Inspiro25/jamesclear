People who want to be big sometimes think, &#8220;I have to immediately reach the largest possible audience.&#8221; But in a weird way, the best way to produce things that take off is to produce small things. To become a small expert. To become the best person on the internet at understanding the application of Medicaid to minority children, or something like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the reason why I think this is true I call my Tokyo example. If you go to Tokyo, you&#8217;ll see there are all sorts of really, really strange shops. There&#8217;ll be a shop that&#8217;s only 1970&#8217;s vinyl and like, 1980&#8217;s whisky or something. And that doesn&#8217;t make any sense if it&#8217;s a shop in a Des Moines suburb, right? In a Des Moines suburb, to exist, you have to be Subway. You have to hit the mass-market immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Tokyo, where there&#8217;s 30-40 million people within a train ride of a city, then your market is 40 million. And within that 40 million, sure, there&#8217;s a couple thousand people who love 1970&#8217;s music and 1980&#8217;s whisky. The Internet is Tokyo. The Internet allows you to be niche at scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niche at scale is something that I think young people should aspire to.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/podcast\/interview-with-derek-thompson-masters-in-business-audio\/id730188152?i=1000383083617\"><em>Masters in Business<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is a small thing that bugs me, but I haven&#8217;t taken the time to fix?
