Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you&#8217;re sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that&#8217;s almost never the case.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/charlierose.com\/videos\/19680\"><em>Interview<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> (March 2007)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine there is a small version of you and a big version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are <em>playing small,<\/em> your behavior is timid, you feel less than, and you are often surrounded by people and projects that drain you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are <em>playing big,<\/em> your behavior is confident, you feel motivated, and you tend to be investing in people and projects that energize you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you spend more time playing the big version of yourself this year?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear <br><em>Author of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\">\u200b<em>Atomic Habits<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/keynote-speaker\">\u200b<em>keynote speaker\u200b<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-12.08.04-PM.png\">\u200bTo be fair, it was a long car ride<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fklein907\/status\/1679866252821671936\">\u200b<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Who knows you is more important than who you know.
