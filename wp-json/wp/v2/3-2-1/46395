Even if one were to walk for one&#8217;s health and it were constantly one station ahead\u2014<em>I would still say: Walk!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, it is also apparent that in walking one constantly gets as close to well-being as possible, even if one does not quite reach it\u2014but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Health and salvation can be found only in motion&#8230; if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/47lQhvf\">\u200b<em>Letters and Documents<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> (hat tip to <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/DylanoA4\/status\/1803408985761972388\">\u200b<em>Dylan O&#8217;Sullivan<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>) <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MayaCPopa\/status\/1715728902067229171\">\u200b<em> <\/em>\u200b<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychologist and Nobel Prize winner <strong>Daniel Kahneman<\/strong> on optimism:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you are allowed one wish for your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism.

Their decisions make a difference; they are the inventors, the entrepreneurs, the political and military leaders \u2013 not average people. They got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They are talented and they have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than they acknowledge&#8230; the people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than they realize.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3Tpc9Qs\">\u200b<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exploration is how you discover what works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Persistence is how you make the most of what already works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does your situation require?
