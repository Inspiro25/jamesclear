In his case, it was the opportunity to become a telegraph messenger boy at age 14:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The interview was successful. I took care to explain that I did not know Pittsburgh, that perhaps I would not do, would not be strong enough; but all I wanted was a trial. He asked me how soon I could come, and I said that I could stay now if wanted. And, looking back over the circumstance, I think that answer might well be pondered by young people. It is a great mistake not to seize the opportunity. The position was offered to me; something might occur, some other boy might be sent for. Having got myself in, I proposed to stay there if I could&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is how, in 1850, I got my first real start in life. From the dark cellar [of my previous job] running a steam-engine at two dollars a week, begrimed with coal dirt, without a trace of elevating influences in life, I was lifted into a paradise, yes, heaven, as it seemed to me, with newspapers, pens, pencils, and sunshine about me. There was scarcely a minute in which I could not learn something or find out how much there was to learn or how little I knew. I felt that my foot was upon the ladder and that I was bound to climb.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0486496376\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0486496376&amp;linkId=e777b335d5db35658b460f81295fff2e\">The Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the most important goal or project you are working on right now.
