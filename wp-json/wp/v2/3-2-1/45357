But I do know that there is incredible value in pain and suffering, if you allow yourself to experience it, to cry, to feel sorrow and grief, to hurt. Walk through the fire and you will emerge on the other end, whole and stronger. I promise. You will ultimately find truth and beauty and wisdom and peace. You will understand that nothing lasts forever, not pain, or joy. You will understand that joy cannot exist without sadness. Relief cannot exist without pain. Compassion cannot exist without cruelty. Courage cannot exist without fear. Hope cannot exist without despair. Wisdom cannot exist without suffering. Gratitude cannot exist without deprivation. Paradoxes abound in this life. Living is an exercise in navigating within them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was deprived of sight. And yet, that single unfortunate physical condition changed me for the better. Instead of leaving me wallowing in self-pity, it made me more ambitious. It made me more resourceful. It made me smarter. It taught me to ask for help, to not be ashamed of my physical shortcoming. It forced me to be honest with myself and my limitations, and eventually to be honest with others. It taught me strength and resilience.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: Letter to her daughters (July 2017) via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/news.lettersofnote.com\/p\/live-a-life-worth-living\">\u200b<em>Letters of Note<\/em>\u200b<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneur and author <strong>Derek Sivers<\/strong> on how to build a business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.
