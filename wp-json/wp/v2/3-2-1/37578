(Russell wrote this at age 81 and went on to live another 16 years.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe best way to overcome [the fear of death]\u2014so at least it seems to me\u2014is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;An individual human existence should be like a river: small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The person&nbsp;who, in old age, can see life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death, since the things he or she cares for will continue. And if, with the decay of vitality, weariness increases, the thought of rest will not be unwelcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do and content in the thought that what was possible has been done.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/gobenyan\/essay\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/gobenyan\/essay\">How to Grow Old<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In what ways are you a difficult person to work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can you learn from that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear<br><em>Author of the million-copy bestseller,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\">Atomic Habits<\/a><\/em><br><em>Creator of <a href=\"https:\/\/habitsacademy.com\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/habitsacademy.com\/\">The Habits Academy<\/a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/habit-journal\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/habit-journal\">Habit Journal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/who-is-this-clown.png\">Who is this clown?<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;It\u2019s never been a better time for self-motivated people.
