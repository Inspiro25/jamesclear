It&#8217;s their first time visiting that restaurant or jumping in that pool or riding that rollercoaster. The world is continually unfolding before them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you introduce more surprise into your life as an adult? How can you renew your sense of childlike wonder?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>III.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the beginning, your skills are raw, your knowledge is sparse, and you lack experience. At best, you will be able to produce work that is &#8220;just okay.&#8221; And even then, you&#8217;ll only manage to reach &#8220;just okay&#8221; by giving your best effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody wants to produce something that is &#8220;just okay.&#8221; You&#8217;ll feel like it&#8217;s beneath your standards. You&#8217;ll worry about what others think of you. You&#8217;ll wonder whether you would be better off taking a different path. But it is impossible to reach that stage unless you are willing to work through your current stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, one of the main obstacles between who you are and who you could be is courage. The courage to keep trying even if you&#8217;re not yet as good as you hope. The courage to keep trying despite your fears of what others may think. The courage to keep trying without knowing how the future will unfold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your great work is on the other side of your early work. The only way to be exceptional later on is to have the courage to be &#8220;just okay&#8221; right now. This is how it is for everyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance executive and entrepreneur&nbsp;<strong>Art Williams<\/strong>&nbsp;on motivation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Almost everybody can stay excited for 2 or 3 months.

More often, it&#8217;s because of some attitude stemming from our efforts to feel in control of our time. We tell ourselves we&#8217;ll turn to it when our urgent work is out of the way, or when we have enough spare time to do it really well; or that we ought first to spend a bit longer researching the best recipients for our charitable donations before making any, et cetera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the only donations that count are the ones you actually get around to making. And while your colleague might appreciate a nicely worded message of praise more than a hastily worded one, the latter is vastly preferable to what&#8217;s truly most likely to happen if you put it off, which is that you&#8217;ll never get around to sending that message.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals\/dp\/0374159122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Four Thousand Weeks<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What career would you realistically pursue if you wanted the most money?<br>What career would you realistically pursue if you wanted the biggest impact?<br>What career would you realistically pursue if you wanted to have the most fun?<br>What career offers the best mix?<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_62f5328fe1076\" class=\"twitter-share \" data-easygut-id=\"twitter\">\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/dyf85\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"27\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 27\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\">\n<circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"14\" r=\"12\" fill=\"#EDEADE\"\/>\n<path d=\"M16.3613 12.1406C16.791 11.8184 17.1777 11.4316 17.4785 10.9805C17.0918 11.1523 16.6406 11.2812 16.1895 11.3242C16.6621 11.0449 17.0059 10.6152 17.1777 10.0781C16.748 10.3359 16.2539 10.5293 15.7598 10.6367C15.3301 10.1855 14.75 9.92773 14.1055 9.92773C12.8594 9.92773 11.8496 10.9375 11.8496 12.1836C11.8496 12.3555 11.8711 12.5273 11.9141 12.6992C10.0449 12.5918 8.36914 11.6895 7.25195 10.3359C7.05859 10.6582 6.95117 11.0449 6.95117 11.4746C6.95117 12.248 7.33789 12.9355 7.96094 13.3438C7.5957 13.3223 7.23047 13.2363 6.92969 13.0645V13.0859C6.92969 14.1816 7.70312 15.084 8.73438 15.2988C8.5625 15.3418 8.34766 15.3848 8.1543 15.3848C8.00391 15.3848 7.875 15.3633 7.72461 15.3418C8.00391 16.2441 8.8418 16.8887 9.83008 16.9102C9.05664 17.5117 8.08984 17.877 7.03711 17.877C6.84375 17.877 6.67188 17.8555 6.5 17.834C7.48828 18.4785 8.66992 18.8438 9.95898 18.8438C14.1055 18.8438 16.3613 15.4277 16.3613 12.4414C16.3613 12.334 16.3613 12.248 16.3613 12.1406Z\" fill=\"#111111\"\/>\n<\/svg>\n<\/a><\/div>\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/dyf85\">Share this on Twitter<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear<br>\u200b<em>Author of the #1 worldwide bestseller,&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Atomic Habits<\/em><\/a><em>\u200b<br>Creator of the&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/habit-journal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Habit Journal<\/em><\/a><em>\u200b<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Sticky-situation.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sticky situation<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Deconstruction creates knowledge.
