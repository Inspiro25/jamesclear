The eaglet hatched with the brood of chickens and grew up with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All his life the eagle did what the barnyard chicks did, thinking he was a barnyard chicken. He scratched the earth for worms and insects. He clucked and cackled. And he would thrash his wings and fly a few feet into the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years passed and the eagle grew very old. One day he saw a magnificent bird above him in the cloudless sky. It glided in graceful majesty among the powerful wind currents, with scarcely a beat of its strong golden wings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The old eagle looked up in awe. &#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the eagle, the king of the birds,&#8221; said his neighbor. &#8220;He belongs to the sky. We belong to the earth\u2014we&#8217;re chickens.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the eagle lived and died a chicken, for that&#8217;s what he thought he was.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Song-Bird-Anthony-Mello\/dp\/0385196156\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Song of the Bird<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens if I slow down?
