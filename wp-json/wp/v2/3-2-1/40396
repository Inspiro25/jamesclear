As a rapidly growing company, it can sometimes be hard to find the space for these so-called war rooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the launch of our games platform we needed to move more people into a war room than could possibly fit in any floor plan. Not to be defeated, the team came in over the weekend and built a loft which could support desks on two levels. This is classic hacking. The team solved a problem on a dimension, quite literally, that was unexpected: when you think of a floor plan you think of width and depth, not height.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be outdone, a few years later when the Messenger team needed to move 15 people into a war room but the largest room we had could only fit 10 people any way you arranged it (including vertically), they cut a hole in the wall and made a bigger room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This example isn\u2019t illustrative for its cleverness but rather for its power as a metaphor. As humans when we walk into a room we are inclined to perceive the four walls around us as permanent, immovable constraints. Some of them are \u2014 we should avoid demolishing structural walls \u2014 but most of them probably are not.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/boz.com\/articles\/the-hacker-way\"><em>The Hacker Way<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is one action that would make today a success?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear <br><em>Author of the multi-million-copy bestseller, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\"><em>Atomic Habits<\/em><\/a><em>\u200b <\/em><br><em>Creator of the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\"><em>Habit Journal<\/em><\/a><em>\u200b<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bubbaprog\/status\/1401010235251298309\">Simone Biles in extreme slow motion<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Patience is a competitive advantage.
