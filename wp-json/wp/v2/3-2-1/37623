The man who has not the habit of reading is imprisoned in his immediate world, in respect to time and space. His life falls into a set routine; he is limited to contact and conversation with a few friends and acquaintances, and he sees only what happens in his immediate neighborhood. From this prison there is no escape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the moment he takes up a book, he immediately enters a different world, and if it is a good book, he is immediately put in touch with one of the best talkers of the world. This talker leads him on and carries him into a different country or a different age, or unburdens to him some of his personal regrets, or discusses with him some special line or aspect of life that the reader knows nothing about. An ancient author puts him in communion with a dead spirit of long ago, and as he reads along, he begins to imagine what that ancient author looked like and what type of person he was&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now to be able to live two hours out of twelve in a different world and take one&#8217;s thoughts off the claims of the immediate present is, of course, a privilege to be envied by people shut up in their bodily prison.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0688163521\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0688163521&amp;linkId=17d4fd8e9054d0b4beec1c40a4fd4497\">The Importance of Living<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What part of this situation is under my control?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear<br><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Author of the million-copy bestseller,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\">Atomic Habits<\/a><br><\/em><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Creator of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\">Habit Journal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/the-human-body.png\">The human body was not made for this<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>p.p.s Hat tip to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lpolovets\/status\/1226709679960494085\">Leo Polovets<\/a>&nbsp;for sharing this week&#8217;s question.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;You can borrow knowledge, but not action.&#8221;
