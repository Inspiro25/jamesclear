The reality of your own nature should determine the speed. If you become restless, speed up. If you become winded, slow down. You climb the mountain in an equilibrium between restlessness and exhaustion. Then, when you&#8217;re no longer thinking ahead, each footstep isn&#8217;t just a means to an end but a unique event in itself. This leaf has jagged edges. This rock looks loose. From this place the snow is less visible, even though closer. These are things you should notice anyway. To live only for some future goal is shallow. It&#8217;s the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here&#8217;s where things grow.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3yTkNjh\">\u200b<em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> (Hat tip to <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/dylanoa4\/status\/1815009146552332654\">\u200b<em>Dylan O&#8217;Sullivan<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>)<\/em>\u200b\u200b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bII.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economics professor <strong>Tyler Cowen<\/strong> on raising the aspirations of others:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yesterday I had lunch with a former Ph.D student of mine, who is now highly successful and tenured at a very good school. I was reminded that, over twenty years ago, I was Graduate Director of Admissions. One of my favorite strategies was to take strong candidates who applied for Masters and also offer them Ph.D admissions, suggesting they might to do the latter. My lunch partner was a beneficiary of this de facto policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least two of our very best students went down this route&#8230; neither realized that it was common simply to apply straight to a Ph.D program, skipping over the Masters. I believe this is now better known, but the point is this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At critical moments in time, you can raise the aspirations of other people significantly, especially when they are relatively young, simply by suggesting they do something better or more ambitious than what they might have in mind. It costs you relatively little to do this, but the benefit to them, and to the broader world, may be enormous. This is in fact one of the most valuable things you can do with your time and with your life.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/marginalrevolution.com\/marginalrevolution\/2018\/10\/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html\">\u200b<em>The high-return activity of raising others\u2019 aspirations<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> (Hat tip to <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/TheAnnaGat\/status\/1824979269962862711\">\u200b<em>Anna G\u00e1t<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What can I do today to practice five minutes of self-care?<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_b0ff0dcb79dce780fd984548dcb368c6\" class=\"twitter-share \" data-easygut-id=\"twitter\">\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/c8jf7\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"27\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 27\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\">\n<circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"14\" r=\"12\" fill=\"#EDEADE\"\/>\n<path d=\"M16.3613 12.1406C16.791 11.8184 17.1777 11.4316 17.4785 10.9805C17.0918 11.1523 16.6406 11.2812 16.1895 11.3242C16.6621 11.0449 17.0059 10.6152 17.1777 10.0781C16.748 10.3359 16.2539 10.5293 15.7598 10.6367C15.3301 10.1855 14.75 9.92773 14.1055 9.92773C12.8594 9.92773 11.8496 10.9375 11.8496 12.1836C11.8496 12.3555 11.8711 12.5273 11.9141 12.6992C10.0449 12.5918 8.36914 11.6895 7.25195 10.3359C7.05859 10.6582 6.95117 11.0449 6.95117 11.4746C6.95117 12.248 7.33789 12.9355 7.96094 13.3438C7.5957 13.3223 7.23047 13.2363 6.92969 13.0645V13.0859C6.92969 14.1816 7.70312 15.084 8.73438 15.2988C8.5625 15.3418 8.34766 15.3848 8.1543 15.3848C8.00391 15.3848 7.875 15.3633 7.72461 15.3418C8.00391 16.2441 8.8418 16.8887 9.83008 16.9102C9.05664 17.5117 8.08984 17.877 7.03711 17.877C6.84375 17.877 6.67188 17.8555 6.5 17.834C7.48828 18.4785 8.66992 18.8438 9.95898 18.8438C14.1055 18.8438 16.3613 15.4277 16.3613 12.4414C16.3613 12.334 16.3613 12.248 16.3613 12.1406Z\" fill=\"#111111\"\/>\n<\/svg>\n<\/a><\/div>\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/c8jf7\">Share this on Twitter<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear <br><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/atomic-habits\">\u200b<em>Atomic Habits<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>, the #1 best-selling book <\/em><br><a href=\"https:\/\/atoms.jamesclear.vercel.app\/\">\u200b<em>Atoms<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>, the official Atomic Habits app <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/3-2-1\">\u200b<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/3-2-1\"><em>3-2-1 newsletter<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> with 3 million subscribers<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/jzux\/status\/1816191752262541514\">\u200b<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Screenshot-2024-08-22-at-1.41.05-PM.png\">The value of siblings\u200b<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Plant the seeds of greatness in your mind.&#8221;
