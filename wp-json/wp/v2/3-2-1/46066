Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a swimmer learns a proper flip turn in the freestyle races, she will swim the race a bit faster; then a streamlined push off from the wall, with the arms squeezed together over the head, and a little faster; then how to place the hands in the water so no air is cupped in them; then how to lift them over the water; then how to lift weights to properly build strength, and how to eat the right foods, and to wear the best suits for racing, and on and on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of those tasks seems small in itself, but each allows the athlete to swim a bit faster. And having learned and consistently practiced all of them together, and many more besides, the swimmer may compete in the Olympic Games&#8230; the little things really do count.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/academics.hamilton.edu\/documents\/themundanityofexcellence.pdf\">\u200b<em>The Mundanity of Excellence<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is something you would be proud to fail on, if you had the courage to attempt it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/4aBUY\">\u200b<em>Share this on Twitter<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear <a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmV2aWV3LmNvbnZlcnRraXQtbWFpbDQuY29tL2NsaWNrL2RwaGVoMGh6aG0vYUhSMGNITTZMeTlxWVcxbGMyTnNaV0Z5TG1OdmJTOWhkRzl0YVdNdGFHRmlhWFJ6\">\u200b<em>Atomic Habits<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>, the #1 best-selling book <\/em><br><a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmV2aWV3LmNvbnZlcnRraXQtbWFpbDQuY29tL2NsaWNrL2RwaGVoMGh6aG0vYUhSMGNITTZMeTloY0hCekxtRndjR3hsTG1OdmJTOTFjeTloY0hBdllYUnZiWE10Wm5KdmJTMWhkRzl0YVdNdGFHRmlhWFJ6TDJsa05qUTNORFF5TVRrd05nPT0=\">\u200b<em>Atoms<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em>, the official Atomic Habits app <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmV2aWV3LmNvbnZlcnRraXQtbWFpbDQuY29tL2NsaWNrL2RwaGVoMGh6aG0vYUhSMGNITTZMeTlxWVcxbGMyTnNaV0Z5TG1OdmJTOHpMVEl0TVE9PQ==\">\u200b<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/preview.convertkit-mail4.com\/click\/dpheh0hzhm\/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmV2aWV3LmNvbnZlcnRraXQtbWFpbDQuY29tL2NsaWNrL2RwaGVoMGh6aG0vYUhSMGNITTZMeTlxWVcxbGMyTnNaV0Z5TG1OdmJTOHpMVEl0TVE9PQ==\"><em>3-2-1 newsletter<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> with 3 million subscribers<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. \u200b<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Screenshot-2024-05-21-at-3.21.30-PM.png\">To be fair, the hospital food isn&#8217;t great<\/a>\u200b.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Clarity isn&#8217;t about knowing what you want to do with your life, it&#8217;s about knowing what you want to do this week.
