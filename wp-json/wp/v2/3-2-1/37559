Gardner&nbsp;<\/strong>was the&nbsp;Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Lyndon Johnson and a&nbsp;recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this passage, he describes&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;tough-minded optimism:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Optimism is unfashionable today, particularly among intellectuals. Everyone makes fun of it. Someone said, &#8220;Pessimists got that way by financing optimists.&#8221; But I am not pessimistic and I advise you not to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;a tough-minded optimism is best. The future is not shaped by people who don&#8217;t really believe in the future. Men and women of vitality have always been prepared to bet their futures, even their lives, on ventures of unknown outcome. If they had all looked before they leaped, we would still be crouched in caves sketching animal pictures on the wall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But I did say tough-minded optimism. High hopes that are dashed by the first failure are precisely what we don&#8217;t need. We have to believe in ourselves, but we mustn&#8217;t suppose that the path will be easy, it&#8217;s tough. Life is painful, and rain falls on the just, and Mr. Churchill was not being a pessimist when he said &#8220;I have nothing to offer, but blood, toil, tears and sweat.&#8221; He had a great deal more to offer, but as a good leader he was saying it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy, and he was also saying something that all great leaders say constantly \u2014 that failure is simply a reason to strengthen resolve.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/great-speeches\/personal-renewal-by-john-w-gardner\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.vercel.app\/great-speeches\/personal-renewal-by-john-w-gardner\">Personal Renewal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: I could have quoted most of this&nbsp;speech by Gardner.
