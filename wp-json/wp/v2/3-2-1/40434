Did they return? We thought not; for most, at least, this was the closing journey of their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it occurred to me this afternoon, remembering, that it had been a happy spectacle, that we had felt no sadness when we spoke of the fact that there would be no return. And rightly\u2014for when any living thing has come to the end of its life cycle we accept that end as natural.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Monarch, that cycle is measured in a known span of months. For ourselves, the measure is something else, the span of which we cannot know. But the thought is the same: when that intangible cycle has run its course it is a natural and not unhappy thing that a life comes to an end.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1452153833\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamesclearema-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1452153833&amp;linkId=95b5350ad504e58fa2e64786b9d80a72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Letters of Note: Volume 2<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the limiting factor?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear<br>\u200b<em>Author of the multi-million-copy bestseller,&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Atomic Habits<\/em><\/a><em>\u200b<br>Creator of the&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/habit-journal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Habit Journal<\/em><\/a><em>\u200b<\/em>\u200b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/invented-clocks.png\">The guy who invented the clock<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Motivation often comes after starting, not before.
