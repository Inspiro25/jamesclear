They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It&#8217;s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says,&nbsp;&#8216;Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,&#8217;&nbsp;[or]&nbsp;&#8216;I love Amazon; I just wish you&#8217;d deliver a little more slowly.&#8217;&nbsp;Impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O4MtQGRIIuA&amp;__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeff Bezos at reInvent, November 2012<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>II.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investor&nbsp;<strong>Josh Wolfe<\/strong>&nbsp;on the best advice he ever received:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The best, most useful advice I ever got was from Jim Watson, [the scientist who discovered DNA], over tea at his New York apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 words, 2 meanings: Avoid boring people.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wolfejosh\/status\/958716082113646592?__s=xxxxxxx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Josh Wolfe, Twitter<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The people who have already walked through the fire can help you do the same.
