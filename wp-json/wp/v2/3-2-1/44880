He got up at four and set out on foot to hunt black grouse, wood grouse, woodcock, and snipe. At eleven he met his friends, who had also been out hunting alone all morning. They converged &#8220;at one of these babbling brooks,&#8221; he wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He outlined the rest of his schedule. &#8220;Take a quick dip, relax with a schnapps and a sandwich, stretch out, have a smoke, take a nap or just rest, and then sit around and chat until three. Then I hunt some more until sundown, bathe again, put on a white tie and tails to keep up appearances, eat a huge dinner, smoke a cigar and sleep like a log until the sun comes up again to redden the eastern sky. This is living &#8230; Could it be more perfect?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/43rd9q4\">\u200b<em>The Writing Life<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-question-for-you\">1 QUESTION FOR YOU<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the current habits that are hindering your future progress?<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"block_0076ce4330e5693995a44d887f3aa07f\" class=\"twitter-share \" data-easygut-id=\"twitter\">\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/15baH\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"27\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 27\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\">\n<circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"14\" r=\"12\" fill=\"#EDEADE\"\/>\n<path d=\"M16.3613 12.1406C16.791 11.8184 17.1777 11.4316 17.4785 10.9805C17.0918 11.1523 16.6406 11.2812 16.1895 11.3242C16.6621 11.0449 17.0059 10.6152 17.1777 10.0781C16.748 10.3359 16.2539 10.5293 15.7598 10.6367C15.3301 10.1855 14.75 9.92773 14.1055 9.92773C12.8594 9.92773 11.8496 10.9375 11.8496 12.1836C11.8496 12.3555 11.8711 12.5273 11.9141 12.6992C10.0449 12.5918 8.36914 11.6895 7.25195 10.3359C7.05859 10.6582 6.95117 11.0449 6.95117 11.4746C6.95117 12.248 7.33789 12.9355 7.96094 13.3438C7.5957 13.3223 7.23047 13.2363 6.92969 13.0645V13.0859C6.92969 14.1816 7.70312 15.084 8.73438 15.2988C8.5625 15.3418 8.34766 15.3848 8.1543 15.3848C8.00391 15.3848 7.875 15.3633 7.72461 15.3418C8.00391 16.2441 8.8418 16.8887 9.83008 16.9102C9.05664 17.5117 8.08984 17.877 7.03711 17.877C6.84375 17.877 6.67188 17.8555 6.5 17.834C7.48828 18.4785 8.66992 18.8438 9.95898 18.8438C14.1055 18.8438 16.3613 15.4277 16.3613 12.4414C16.3613 12.334 16.3613 12.248 16.3613 12.1406Z\" fill=\"#111111\"\/>\n<\/svg>\n<\/a><\/div>\n\t<div><a href=\"https:\/\/ctt.ac\/15baH\">Share this on Twitter<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next week,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Clear <br><em>Author of <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/atomichabits.com\/\">\u200b<em>Atomic Habits<\/em>\u200b<\/a><em> and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/keynote-speaker\">\u200b<em>keynote speaker\u200b<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>p.s. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShortSleeveSuit\/status\/1082725616619872256\">\u200b<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-25-at-11.28.16-AM.png\">Get better soon<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShortSleeveSuit\/status\/1082725616619872256\">\u200b<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>3 IDEAS FROM ME I. &#8220;Just because improvements aren&#8217;t visible doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t happening.
