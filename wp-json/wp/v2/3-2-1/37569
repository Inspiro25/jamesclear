What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you\u2019re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you\u2019re on a bad trajectory; if your spending habits don\u2019t change, it\u2019s not going to end well. Conversely, if you\u2019re broke, but you save more than you spend every month, then you\u2019re on the path toward financial freedom\u2014even if you\u2019re moving slower than you\u2019d like.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-2-quotes-from-others\">2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author <strong>Elizabeth&nbsp;Gilbert<\/strong> on time management:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve reached a certain age then you know what works for you. You should know by this point in your life what time of day you\u2019re &#8216;good&#8217; \u2014 like what time of day is your brain at its best. Because the reality is we all get, maybe, two good hours a day where we actually feel awake and alert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And the big, important question is: Who currently gets that time from you. The best time from your brain every day\u2014who or what currently gets that? And would you be willing to take it back so that it\u2019s yours and then give the world the &#8216;second-rate&#8217;&nbsp;version of you (which is the other 22 hours of the day)\u2026&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/armchairexpertpod.com\/pods\/elizabeth-gilbert\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/armchairexpertpod.com\/pods\/elizabeth-gilbert\">Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, episode #111: Elizabeth Gilbert<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>II.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second quote today is from author&nbsp;<strong>Leo Tolstoy<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you want to do a good deed, do it now.
