					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

You&#039;re one of the best writers I have ever read...but the only one who works hard before writing and presenting simple and easy language.

I&#039;m learning and also teaching your techniques to my students. (I am a 25 year old school teacher.)

Thanks for your very effective article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, thanks for sharing this.  Your habit forming ideas are going to transform lives.  For you to have learned this at a relatively young age is remarkable. I, like Ira, feel it took so long to learn to learn, but I was willing to do the work and continue to develop, what I think, are useful and transforming habits. I look forward to all your future newsletters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot of that piece.

I&#039;ve been following you for sometime (since mostly the beginning) and I&#039;ve gotta say your writing is getting better and better. Your articles are just full of great content. I just love how you always include nice quotes, research papers and so on, and how you link them together.

For me, it&#039;s always been though to deal with the inside pressure I often demand myself for delivering awesome work. I always thought that kind of perfection is good, but it&#039;s actually not. Like a really successful guy I know tell people: &quot;Perfection is often a defect, because you never deliver.&quot;. I guess he is right and I have to accept that my work is just not good enough to my standards right now, but will eventually reach that point where I can be really proud of. It&#039;s just that the patient to get there is really tough. So, I try to think of that 10 yr silence time we all have to go through, and I think it&#039;s a normal thing to struggle with that. It&#039;s just not natural at the start, but if understand how it works and it has been working for all the successful people, then maybe we can have the commitment and patient to let our work grow/mature.

Cheers,
Lucas]]></description>

She&#039;s right, James- I disagreed with your point #2 about writing- you put in the work and you DO come up with something of note, quite consistently. :-)]]></description>
