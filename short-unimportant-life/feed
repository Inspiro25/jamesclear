					<description><![CDATA[This article reminds me of a survey that has been held a few years ago and allegedly proved that married people live longer; turned out this applied only for happily married ones, not for the many who were trapped in an unhappy marriage which even shortened their life expectancy and made them susceptible to all kinds of diseases. 

Your article applies for some people, the social, gregarious, extrovert ones, and even if they may still pose the majority, they are by no means the only people on this planet. 

The population also consists of those who were actually smart enough to avoid adding to the problem of overpopulation, hence didn&#039;t reproduce, and those who prefer being alone, who are interested in books and objects rather than people (so--called things--people as opposed to people--people),  who don&#039;t want to socialize but instead devote their lives to their work, studies, projects, science, or art. 

It is very biased to not only exclude this part of the population but, worse yet, portrait their way of life as undesirable and even unhealthy.

If I were being forced to hang out with people, I&#039;d much rather die before retirement than get old.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments of this article James! I too often find myself engrossed in reading something that I become an information consumer and nothing more. We can forget that our contribution may resonate with someone else in the world. 

On the more general point of dignity and self-worth I think there is much to be said about the loss of our everyday social serendipity - by relegating face time and spending more time digesting information on the screen we are alienating a very important psychological function - i.e. human interaction and empathy. In a world of emoticons and status updates, where the emotion is represented in pixels I think this has sapped our everyday ability to share emotional experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article James. I particularly like the line, &quot;Play a game instead of watching one.&quot; I live by this statement and rarely watch any sports on TV. I try and play as many of them like soccer, volleyball, ultimate and rugby. I&#039;m tired of everyone watching hockey and football and not doing anything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just joined your community, so firstly would like to say Hey Everyone! :)

Loving the article - simple, but thought provoking. Would make an interesting experiment to commit to do at least a single contribution every day for 30 days and journal personal well-being, I&#039;d suspect some mind blowing revelations.

So how about I start this morning by contributing a simple ritual used to building healthy self-esteem - Compliment Other People! Works like magic and is kinda in spirit with the article.

Have a great day

Thanks for sharing your experience, Pepper. Service is one of the central values of this community. I often say that your impact can only be as big as your willingness to serve. It&#039;s wonderful to hear that service has been the cornerstone of your career and success.

Please come back and share your thoughts at anytime.

p.s. The web designer you&#039;re referring to is none other than my friend Katie Benedetto. She&#039;s great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find that a life based on service is the ultimate way to live. I recently found another young web designer who figured this out. She was finding that serving certain clients gave her more satisfaction. After a few clients like this and other inspired moments in her life, she changed the byline of her business to &quot;web dev for good&quot;. (She is the designer/developer of http://yellowrubberball.com and I met her at the 2012 &quot;indieconf&quot; in Raleigh, North Carolina.)

I celebrate this. As a web designer who has completed 43 joyous years (so far) in the web and print design business, I too learned this realization, devoted my career to educational materials and non-profit organizations, and experience joy and exhilaration on a daily basis. I know I mattered. I felt the value people felt in my work. The joy has been endless. I am as exhilarated and happy each day of work today as I was back in my 20s and I&#039;m thriving at 62 like that famous bunny.

Giving keeps you young. Yes, indeed!

Thank you for presenting this good story again to the world James!]]></description>
