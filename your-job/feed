					<description><![CDATA[Dear James, I am drowning in a sea of self-doubt, trembling at the thought of moving forward...moving backward would be terrible, moving forward is terrifying. But as you have stated, the worst judge of my movement is myself. 

I will re-read you words and try to take them into my world.

Thank you, E.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A quote I love: &quot;&quot;The miracle isn&#039;t that I finished. The miracle is that I had the courage to start.&quot; - John Bingham 
And I have literally spent time in a wheelchair (I am now walking with a terrific new leg). A perhaps unintended truth to your analogy James: it causes some muscles to tighten up and makes it difficult to move normally again. So it isn&#039;t so much comfortable as it is crippling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. There always seem to be lots of reasons why it&#039;s not a good time to get started. 

One that I fall into a lot is comparing myself with others when starting out. I have to remind myself that everyone had to start at the beginning once, and that I only need to compete with myself. And I&#039;ll add to that your advice that it is my job to say yes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;So. What.&quot; Love it.

Much of my life has been too consumed with the WPTs. That would be What People Think. My feelings, my presumptions, my hyper-concern for what others think was one of the most effective barriers to pursuing/achieving anything in life. 

At one point it had my hands so tightly tied that a diagnosis of agoraphobia followed. 

It was only upon the release of those beliefs, the seeking of others-centered approval and by ultimately surrendering the excessive search for validation that I was able to gain confidence via an increased internal strength. 

How did I gain that strength? ONLY by doing. They call it In Vivo Exposure. Confronting that which is feared a small step at a time. And discovering that you won&#039;t die! Then discovering the elation that accomplishment brings. 20 years later those limiting thoughts still exist. 

But So. What.

Sometimes I confront them. But more often I ignore them, allowing them NO power ... while taking the next, necessary step into fear. 

Thanks James, for the reminder of how far I&#039;ve come. And for kicking my butt to keep going ... by resigning from the job of telling myself &quot;NO!&quot;]]></description>
