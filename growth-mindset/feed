					<description><![CDATA[James,

Another great article.  I totally agree with what you (and Dr. Dweck) state about the power of small wins and the way it can boost confidence, ability and ultimately success.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/growth-mindset#comment-7456&quot;&gt;Ruth&lt;/a&gt;.

Ruth, just for the record - and Richard may already acknowledge this - the &quot;as if&quot; principle is probably best explained and propounded in the works of philosopher-linguist Alfred Korzybski: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics

I use a similar notion in my therapy work, but I call it assumptions. Distinct from beliefs, which can usually be named and described, assumptions are usually invisible, appear everywhere and are the most powerful feature of your mental world. I&#039;ve written about it here: http://actofliving.com.au/2011/04/suppose-you-assumed-this/ and also here: http://contextualscience.org/WC11_program_symposia

The hard part is uncovering what assumptions you already hold - or more accurately, hold you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is your second impressive article in January! You have kicked it up a notch or two this year.

The informative one percent piece was the first and now this gem. I have shared these with my pre teen kids so that they may start out thinking better of themselves than I did. I lived a fixed mindset until mid years of university where I believed I was as smart and athletically adept as I was and that was it. Fortunately, I witnessed roommates with stronger study habits and followed their lead of hard work and training.

Glad I signed up for your newsletter. Thanks.

					<description><![CDATA[Loved the article James. As an entrepreneur I often face the &#039;sometimes confident, sometimes not confident&#039; syndrome. Guess its just about doing the small things right on the day you are NOT feeling confident to make things feel right again. Just read a quote on the internet that said-&quot;If you are only going to work on days you feel good, you aren&#039;t going to get much done.&quot; Matches perfectly with what you&#039;ve said in this article. Kudos.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, again! 

In that Mindset book, one thing gave me a deep impression is the experiment they did with two sets drawings done by a same group of people, once done before they received any teaching on how to draw, and once after they&#039;ve been taught a few basics through a course. And the difference is so huge and so amazing that we&#039;d all think those drawings would come from two entirely different groups of people. So that simple experiment just proves that our innate abilities, even those in arts like, drawing, singing, painting etc., are all learn-able and they are never fixed. We can all get better through practice and proper teaching and training.

It&#039;s an eye-opening book. Highly recommend if you haven&#039;t read it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[James, nice article. You are right, actions can drive mindset: “If you could display your ability to do something, then you would naturally become confident in your ability to do it again”, but sometimes you need that self confidence to display your ability. In the beginning of your article you also wrote: “If we wanted to become the type of team that stepped onto the court and believed we would win every game, then we had to become the type of team that displayed our ability over and over again.” See, the belief comes first. “Believe and you will become” is not a BS. Granted, it should be accompanied by action.]]></description>
