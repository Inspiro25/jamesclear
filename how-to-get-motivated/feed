					<description><![CDATA[I opened this article thinking &quot;This probably is going to be completely irrelevant, but it deserves a shot.&quot; It was worth it!

I&#039;ll be trying this for schoolwork and painting, both of which are things I need to do, but have a hard time bringing myself to do regularly.

This was very helpful, and the kind of article that will be stuck in my head for a long time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just graduated two years ago and can&#039;t seem to stay put in one job. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s motivation or lack of interest in the job I am currently in. I easily find my current job it&#039;s not so interesting anymore. 

Before I got to work I keep telling myself &quot;JUST SUCK IT UP&quot; but this only got me motivated for at least 3 months...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to have a lot of motivation when I was young. I lost it about 10 years ago. I&#039;ve read your post, and I just feel like crying.

Its seems so simple and obvious when I look back at those years, the only times I was actually able to stick with an idea is when I did the exact things you mentioned.

I&#039;ve really needed to read this. And it also came in the perfect moment. Thank you so much. :)]]></description>
