					<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;m lucky in that I&#039;ve been an avid reader all my life. I routinely read three or four books per week, sometimes more, and have done this since I was a kid. Part of it was probably due to the fact that I found TV boring. I never even owned one after I left home, and now have one because I live in France and it&#039;s good for learning the language, and also because we get Brit TV on sattelite and it is magnificent. But I stall can only stand at most a couple of hours of TV before I get bored with just being the receiver of entertainment. 

My view of reading is that you should not look on it as a chore. It&#039;s just what you do and what you make time for. I wake up at six in the morning, and sit in bed reading for a couple of hours or so, with coffee of course. I can&#039;t think of a better way to start the day. When I was still working, I used to read on the train, on the subway, at lunchtime, in the evening (People who read are never without a book). I&#039;d read for at least an hour before going to sleep. I&#039;d fall asleep reading rather than watching TV. If you want to read, just do it. And ditch the TV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article and advice.

I have made reading more a goal, however, with so many distractions and obligations it&#039;s difficult to stick to that goal. The advice here makes the goal very manageable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful and important post James and exactly what I have done for years, and it works a treat.  I pinched it directly from Charlie Munger who said pay yourself for the first hour of the day - and he used it to broaden his knowledge.

I would add another layer to the reading 20 pages per day; it should be material that will leave you going to bed smarter than when you woke up.  The sort of material you have to work on when you read it.  The &#039;Deliberate Practice&#039; of reading, hence novels don&#039;t make it into this period for me, they go in the &#039;preparing for bed&#039; end of the day.

Keep up the great posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoy your articles. I&#039;m impressed with the number of books you are able to read in a year. It really is all about consistency, isn&#039;t it?

Thanks for inspiring me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent James, only a brief comment.

It is not only the quantity but the quality of what you read that matter. Information is like food, while a good diet will keep you healthier and more productive, fast food will kill you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a problem with reading a while ago. I don&#039;t do reflect on what I read and I read a lot. I used to forget everything. As much as you can say reading is beneficial, it&#039;s not good if you&#039;re not doing anything with it. 

Now you might say that 20 pages is enough content for you to remember, but unless you have specific strategies to employ what you are reading, whether by simply reflecting on it or applying it to something, you&#039;re probably not getting anything out of it.

I try to read at least 10 pages each day and I increase that depending on how relevant the content is to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love to read but I find myself out of the habit.  I do a lot of reading on the internet and I think that has been, in part, the reason for less time spent with my nose in a book.  I have a short attention span as it is and FB and Twitter don&#039;t help. 

I am going to go read 20 pages right now of the book I got from the library last week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi James,

Only recently discovered your site via Quora and working my way through your articles and really enjoying it.

This article resonated with me because it&#039;s exactly what I do as well and have done so for a number of years now, although I set a target of 30 pages per day.  

It still surprises me how many people ask how I can read so many books when I think it&#039;s such a simple habit.  Imagine if they didn&#039;t watch the morning news (which was my old habit and took way more than 30 minutes!).

The quote that started it all for me was &quot;Do the most important thing first in the morning and you will never have an unproductive day&quot;.  

So I go for a run as soon as I get up (and &quot;surprise, surprise!&quot; people are also surprised how much I run each week and that I don&#039;t have a weight problem despite being in my 50&#039;s) and then I read for 30 minutes when I get back while I am cooling down.

Everything after that is a bonus for the day.  And if something important happened while I was out running or reading someone will tell me if it&#039;s important enough that I know.

Love your work.]]></description>
