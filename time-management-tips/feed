					<description><![CDATA[I just don&#039;t know James... I spend a lot of my times with activities that require momentum. Like reading books, studying and programming. It doesn&#039;t feel like I can introduce moments of intensity easily to those.

It&#039;s kind of awkward to decide to stop in the middle of a sentence. Sometimes when I&#039;m reading a book, I feel like I need to read a couple of pages to get something and if I don&#039;t do that all at the same time, I will have have to start all over again.

There&#039;s more to this than just doing it. I&#039;m going to be thinking about it though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They say the teacher will come when the student is ready. The three advices in the article are exactly what I needed in this point of my life - real lifesavers. 

Thank you, James, for turning theory in practice - this is what I often lack with certain &quot;gurus&quot;. And thank you for enspiring me every single time.

					<description><![CDATA[Being someone who prides herself on being productive, it can be hard to admit that from time-to-time I allow myself to become so distracted. Half-work sucks the life right out of you! Doing my most difficult task first thing in the morning (eating my frog!) has become a winning strategy for me too.

Thanks for the great website/blog!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/time-management-tips#comment-783&quot;&gt;Nutter&lt;/a&gt;.

Nutter, I am a super-interesting guy. Totally modest, too. You sound like an interesting girl! 

I like the idea that you can allow yourself to if you have achieved your goals for the day. I totally agree, and it applies to more than just daydreaming. Right now I am working on setting my goals appropriately, though! 

I find that a glass of merlot can really help with the creative process too, or at least make me think my waltz moves are better than they really are.

As for daydreaming/listening to podcasts, James inspired me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.golivetheadventure.net/3/post/2013/04/when-half-work-is-effective.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;write a post on it&lt;/a&gt;.

Maybe it explains a little more. I would love to keep the thoughts going on the topic!]]></description>

Moose, you sound like a very interesting guy.

I&#039;m with you on the daydreaming thing, but because I I lose focus TOO often I have to treat it as a reward. So, if I&#039;ve been a good girl and achieved my goals for the day I can...put something blues-y on the stereo, waltz barefoot around the kitchen singing (horribly), and cook up a bunch of paleo meals, all while my brain is on &quot;idle&quot;...

(Oh, yeah. There&#039;s often a glass of merlot in this equation.)

BTW, Mark Sisson totally rocks, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.vercel.app/time-management-tips#comment-588&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey James - 

I agree, some people would definitely say I would be happier if I was doing just one of those tasks and not mind-wandering (have you seen the TEDx on happiness by Matt Killingsworth?). This is a perfect case-study of an example where you cannot believe everything you are told, and must test it out and see what works for you! After all, Einstein is said to have thought up his theory of relativity while riding his bicycle. That&#039;s definitely not staying in the moment! 

I find that I have also come up with some of my best ideas while daydreaming (My ideas have not received as much acceptance as Einstein&#039;s ... yet!). Of course, it is certainly important to be conscious of how often it occurs; again, I agree with you that about 90% of the time half-work is detrimental to our productivity and happiness. However, if I allow myself to half-work or daydream at certain times (while cooking for myself - I will include listening to podcasts in this because they often spark ideas that I daydream about while hopefully not burning my lunch), I greatly expand my potential for coming up with an idea that I may not have had otherwise. 

For me, the major breakthrough in this respect came when I started to do some brain training, which allowed me to begin to recall things that I thought of while daydreaming (the types of things that commonly slip away...). The brain training I worked with (and am still experimenting with) included dream-hacking as well as conscious n-back training. 

It seems to me that there is something in our genes that allows us to mind-wander and daydream during times that are not life-or-death situations. Mark Sisson has talked about the importance of letting yourself daydream. I imagine that our ancestors, with far more time spent in fight-or-flight situations, did not have the ability to daydream as much as our current lives allow us to. Yet, in moments when they were able to let their minds slip off, there must have been an evolutionary benefit to them doing it (perhaps the idea behind the creation of the knife came from daydreaming?). The problem today is that we have much more time spent in situations when we can daydream (or worse, mind-wander negatively = worry), and thus we need to learn on an individual level how to manage it effectively. For some, that is never half-working or day dreaming. For others, it may be more often. 

All the best until next time,
