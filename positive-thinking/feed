					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/positive-thinking#comment-13600&quot;&gt;John Salada&lt;/a&gt;.

I have been reading about PMA for decades, but the one you have shared is really very practical and easy to implement. For positivism there are no limits. I experienced that being religious and spiritual helps in having a positvely oriented fast. As you think so you become, it is said in Bhagavat Gita &quot;yat bhavam tat bhavathi&quot;.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this wonderful thoughts/messages and experiences... It helps me a lot as a person.

I am a negative thinker so this is probably great and I want to apply this on my daily living not only as that, especially do it for myself. I must need to be a positive thinker so that it will lead to my positive life. Because in my living I always cope with problems, money, family, etc...

Thanks again!]]></description>

John -- thanks for making that distinction. Do you have any suggestions for further reading on the difference between positive thinking vs. positive emotions? I&#039;m always looking to learn more.

And thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You interchange positive thinking with positive emotions, when in fact they are very different. This entire article and Fredrickson&#039;s studies deal with positive EMOTIONS. I think you have a great, well-said point, but your title and the rest of your piece is misleading.]]></description>
